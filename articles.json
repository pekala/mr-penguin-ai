      "text": "Welcome to Pleo! Before you can start spending with Pleo cards and all that good stuff, there are a few verification steps. This article explains \"the why\" of Pleo's verification process, as well as \"the how\": Set up your login credentials Complete the admin verification steps Verify other key people How to get help with the verification process The why Ever watched the critically acclaimed Netflix show Ozark? It\u2019s all about crime, and money laundering in particular. Which is something that we take very seriously. As a financial services company, Pleo abides by the regulations of the 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive. And, being founded in Denmark, we also comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Regulation for Denmark. Simply put, we need to be able to prove that your company is legit. This includes verifying the ownership structure and management control. Pleo is not a bank, but similar KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations apply. Just as you need to prove your identity when opening a personal bank account, we need documentation that ensures that your company (and you) are real. We don\u2019t want any bad guys using Pleo\u2014not even the charming ones like Marty Byrde from Ozark. S et up your login credentials After you sign up for a Pleo account, you\u2019ll get a link via email that prompts you to set up your login credentials. At this stage, Pleo will also prompt you to select your company from a list that's synced with your country's company registry (e.g., Companies House in the UK). Complete the admin verification steps As the person setting up the account, you are the administrator in charge of verification. Considering this level of access, we\u2019ll need to verify you personally in order to meet due diligence guidelines. Log into Pleo. Click \u201cStart Verification.\u201d Submit a form of personal identification: Photo ID (valid passport, driver\u2019s licence, or national ID card): Please make sure that the document is a live photograph of your physical ID (i.e., not a photo of the digital version of your, 2) that the entire page is visible, and that there aren't any light reflections. NemID (Danish accounts only) Bank ID and Personnummer (Swedish accounts only) Netherlands: e-ID Finland: e-ID Verify other key people Good stuff! There\u2019s still a wee bit more to do. You will see a list of Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) or Executive Directors who\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014own 25% or more of shares and/or voting rights. In the case of an association or charity, all board members need to be verified. This list is automatically pulled from the national registry. If there are any mistakes, you can chat with us to let us know. Log into Pleo. Go to the company info page. You\u2019ll be asked to enter the date of birth and current residential address of any key people. If a date or birth or residential address is incorrect, you might see a prompt to upload a photo ID and/or proof of address for any key people: Photo ID: same as the above requirements for admins (although not a live photo though you're submitting the documents on behalf of other key people). Proof of address: You can use a driver\u2019s licence if it lists the address, so long as the licence wasn\u2019t also submitted as the ID. Any letter must be dated within the past three months. This could be a government letter, bank statement, or utility bill (electricity, water, or gas\u2014no mobile phone bills, sorry!). In Denmark, a health card (a.k.a yellow card) is fine. All documents are handled with complete confidentiality and are purely retained for legal compliance reasons. If you\u2019re interested, please feel free to read through our privacy policy . As soon as we\u2019ve got everything, you\u2019ll receive an email confirming that the verification process is done and dusted. Meaning it\u2019s time for all the fun stuff; topping up your Wallet, inviting your colleagues to join the account, and ordering cards . How to get help with the verification process If something goes wrong with your admin verification or if you see an error message, our compliance team will reach out to you by email within one business day. If it\u2019s been more than a business day and you don\u2019t see anything in your inbox, please try checking your spam folder. If you\u2019ve not received anything by email, if the verification page in Pleo is giving you trouble (e.g., you see an ellipsis as the page keeps trying to load), or if you have any questions at all, please contact our support team and we\u2019ll be happy to help."

      "text": "Congrats; your company's Pleo account is officially verified , and it's time to start the fun. This article explains three steps for admins to get started with Pleo: How to top up your Wallet How to invite your colleagues (and external bookkeeper) How to order plastic Pleo cards How to top up your Wallet When you and your colleagues use Pleo cards, all payments are withdrawn from funds in a single company Wallet. There are a couple different ways to send money to your Wallet. We actually have another article that explains the different options. But for your first time, this is how it works: Go to the \" Wallet \" page. Click \"Top up\" . You will see your unique transfer details connected to your Wallet. Send some money\u2014to the aforementioned transfer details\u2014from your company's bank account. It usually takes one (generally a maximum of two) business days for the funds to appear in your Wallet. Your first transfer takes 24 hours longer than usual. The reason is that we need to make sure that the money arrived from a bank account or e-money account that matches the name of your Pleo account and is registered in the UK or EEA. So (pretty) please don't send funds from a personal account or an e-money service that hides the sender's details. First transfer nerves? No one in Pleo or any other organisation has access to your funds. Learn about where your Wallet funds are held . How to invite your colleagues (and external bookkeeper) Nobody is an island. That's certainly the case with Pleo; the more colleagues use it, the more you'll get to streamline spending across the whole organisation. With that in mind: Go to the \" People \" page. Click the \"Add member\" button in the top right hand corner. Enter the email of one or multiple colleagues. Click \"Invite to Pleo\". Your colleague(s) will receive an email inviting them to join the company account. Everyone you invite this way will automatically have an \"employee\" role. You can always change someone's role later (you'll see the option after clicking on their profile in the People page). For external bookkeepers, follow the same first two steps listed above. At step three, click the text that says \"External bookkeeper? Give them access \u2192\" and follow the on-screen steps. Learn more about Pleo bookkeepers . How to order plastic Pleo cards Time to get your hands on some Pleo cards! Your first two orders are free, so if your colleagues are quick to accept the invite to join Pleo, it's a good idea to order their cards in bulk: Go to the \" Cards \" section under the People page. Click on the \"Order cards\" button in the top right corner. Select the people who need a physical card and click \"Continue \". The next page will show you the default delivery address. If you're ordering a card for a remote colleague, click the \"Edit address\" button. Click \"Confirm order\". The cards arrive in 5-7 business days. In the meantime, a virtual Pleo card lets you pay online as well as in-store (with Apple Pay and Google Pay)."

This article explains three key steps for getting started: How to accept the invite How to activate your Pleo card How to pay with your Pleo card and attach a receipt How to accept the invite The person who invites you to Pleo is the account admin. Here's what to do once you've received the invite to your work email: Click the \"Join your team\" button in the email invite. Next, click \"Continue on web.\" Set up your passcode and two-factor authentication method. Download the Pleo mobile app (available for iOS and Android). You'll be able to log in with the same credentials you've just set up. How to activate your Pleo card Just like sending out invites, the Pleo admin takes care of ordering plastic cards. They'll organise for someone to deliver the cards in person at the office, or delivered to your home address if you work remotely. Before you start using your plastic card though, it's up to you to pair it with your Pleo app. Go to the \"My cards\" section and follow the on-screen instruction. Here's what it looks like in the web app : And in the mobile app: Click the \"Show PIN\" button to view your card pin (not to be confused with the passcode you set up for logging into your account). It's not possible to change your pin code, but you can always view it in the Pleo app if you forget what it is. It's also possible to activate a virtual card. A virtual card can be used for online purchases and subscriptions. Both your plastic and virtual cards can be used with Google Pay or Apple Pay . How to pay with your Pleo card and attach a receipt Whenever you pay in-store Pleo card, you will immediately receive a notification reminding you to take a photo of the paper receipt and add any extra info (e.g., the project that the expense is lined to). If you've made an online purchase with a Pleo card, you can add a digital receipt by attaching the file from your camera roll or uploading it from your computer. \"Tags\" help accountants organise spending according to cost type (travel, meals, etc.). No worries if you're not sure which Tag(s) to choose. You can always ask a manager or colleague, then add the Tag(s) later. Good to know: If you're using Pleo for out of pocket expenses, please check out this guide . If you need help from our team, here's how to get in touch ."

Once you've been connected to a client, here's how you can access their Pleo account: If you're working independently: click on your profile picture in the bottom left corner and switch between client accounts. If you're working with one of Pleo's partner accountancies , go to the \" Clients \" page, click on the three dots next to a client's name, and click \"Go to client\" . How to connect Pleo to your client's accounting system You know what sounds a bit stressful? Waiting months and months to account for Pleo expenses and then rushing through a backlog of card expenses to meet the deadline for closing the books. Instead, connect Pleo to an accounting system as soon as possible. That way, card expenses can be reconciled on an ongoing, stress-free basis. Go to the \" Settings \" page in Pleo. Click on \" Accounting .\" Click on your client's accounting system in the list. How to set up Categories Categories in Pleo reflect your chart of accounts. When someone uses their Pleo card, they can choose a category  Once set up it allows employees to assign a category that automatically aligns with your chart of accounts and pre-selected tax code. A good example of a category name might be \"Food and drinks.\" To sync Categories with your accounting system: Go to the \" Settings \" page in Pleo. Click on \" Accounting .\" Click on \" Categories .\" You'll see that several Category groups are already listed. These are just a few generic examples that Pleo displays by default. It's up to you  to add, edit, and delete Categories based on your needs. If you are connected to a specific accounting system: Click inside a Category field and select from the drop-down list (this is where you'll see all of the accounts that are automatically synced with your accounting system). If you're on the custom format option: You can choose to enter Categories manually or add them as a .csv file by clicking the \"Export or import\" button in the top right corner. How to set up Tags Tags in Pleo reflect your tracking categories in Xero(Xero), offering another layer to help organise company spending. For example, if the Category was \"Meals and drinks,\" the Tag might reflect the name of a project like \"Portugal launch\" for which refreshments had to be purchased for a specific event. To sync Tags with your accounting system: Go to the \" Settings \" page in Pleo. Click on \" Accounting .\" Click on \" Tags .\" Click on \"Create tag group\" in the top right corner.

        "description": "Understanding refunds, authorisation reversals and chargebacks in Pleo and how to handle them"
      },
      "text": "There are many reasons you may need to have an order cancelled or request a refund. Whatever those reasons are, we've got you covered with the information you need. In this article we cover: Refunds Authorisation reversals Chargebacks Refunds Sometimes you make a purchase that you no longer need, the product is not as expected once it arrives or you simply change your mind. In these cases you'll want to return the product/cancel your order and request a refund. Refunds will need to settled with the merchant. If they refuse, check out the chargeback section at the bottom of this article. Refunds can only be made to the same Pleo card used to make the purchase. All refunds are subject to the merchant's refund policy - e.g. if you purchase a non-refundable plane ticket and want a refund, Pleo cannot assist you with securing a refund. What if the bookkeeper has already exported an expense for a returned item? Whenever a refund comes in, it will show up as positive (+) in the Pleo Wallet balance. You can attach a credit note (something you get from the merchant) to the refund in Pleo. It's possible to export refunds to your accounting system where the original expense and refund is balanced out. Authorisation reversals Each merchant will have its own way of processing transactions. Some will take the funds immediately and others may authorise (reserve) the funds in your account and take it at a later date. In this situation, when an order is cancelled for any reason, the merchant will reverse the authorisation of the funds. For example, you buy something with your Pleo card, but the merchant is out of stock and won\u2019t be able to deliver the goods. So they cancel the order and issue an authorisation reversal. Tip: Authorisation reversals may appear as a 'double charge' in Pleo. The reason for this is likely due to a receipt being added to the original authorisation (stopping it from being removed automatically), then instead of disappearing, the original authorisation plus the reversal is displayed. Solution: Download the receipt from Pleo (in case you need it in the future). Delete the receipt from the original authorisation. As soon as it is deleted, the original charge plus reversal should both disappear within 24 hours . Other situations that cause 'double charge' expenses: A merchant does not take funds within 11 days from the payment authorisation but they do take the funds after this period. Follow the tip and solution above to rectify. A merchant takes payment, you request a refund. Ideally the merchant creates a refund based on the initial charge, but instead creates a new transaction where they choose to not settle the funds but refund them. This will settle itself but, please reach out to support if it does not settle within 11 days. Chargebacks Sometimes a merchant may refuse to issue a refund where you are entitled to one. For this you can initiate something called a chargeback - you will need to secure written confirmation that the merchant refuses to issue a refund before initiating a chargeback. You can Send this documentation (as a PDF) to our Support team at support@pleo.io . What happens once a chargeback is initiated: We will contact Mastercard, issuing them with a Customer Dispute Form, who in turn send the dispute to the merchant. The merchant then has 45 days to respond. The merchant can either agree to return the money or dispute our claim with stronger proof. If the merchant is able to prove they are right in charging the card, then the cardholder loses the right to the money, in this situation, Pleo would also apply a 20GBP fee as chargeback processing fees. Good to know: You will only get a refund if you win the case. Only the cardholder in question, or an Admin on the account can submit this form. It is also required that the form is submitted in English, this is a requirement of Mastercard, who we submit the form to directly."

      "text": "This article is for any employees wondering how much they're allowed to spend with their Pleo card. It's also for anyone who's card was declined and needs to chase their reviewer and/or admin to get their spending limits increased. The article explains: Types of spending limits How to find your spending limits How to find your reviewer(s) and other account contacts Types of spending limits Limits are set by your admins, bookkeepers (with extended access) and reviewers (only for the people on their team). Spending limits are available to our customers on paid plans . There are two types of spending limits: Card limit: This can be either a \"monthly\" (calendar month) or \"total\" (calendar year). This is a \"soft\" limit, meaning that it's only possible to go over the limit once before the card(s) are disabled. Let's say my monthly limit is 500 pounds per month and I've already spent 450. If I try to spend 51 pounds, it will work even though I've exceeded my monthly limit by 1 pound. The logic here is that you don't want limits to inconvenience people who need to use their cards. If someone is consistently overshooting their monthly limit, you can always have a chat with them and/or adjust their per purchase limit. Limit per purchase: This refers to any single purchase. This is a \"hard\" limit, meaning that any payment over this amount is automatically declined. All cards (physical and/or virtual) are disabled when limits are reached. Cards with monthly spending limits are re-enabled at the beginning of each calendar month. Cards with total spending limits are re-enabled if the spending limits are increased or reset manually. How to find your spending limits In the web app: Click on \"My cards\" . On the right hand side of the page, find the \"Card limits\" section.

In the web app: Follow the above steps on \"Finding your spending limits in the Pleo web app\". Click the \"Managed by\" banner. Scroll through the separated list of bookkeepers, admins and reviewers and decide who to contact.

You can double check if you've allowed Pleo to send you notifications on your iOS (iPhone) or Android device. Click on the notification and it'll take you to the camera in the Pleo app . Just aim at the receipt, take a photo and upload! As long as the image isn't blurry, you can throw that receipt away. The receipt will be paired with the right transaction and automatically categorised (e.g., Meals and drinks). You can also add a tag (e.g., lunch allowance), if your manager or Pleo admin has asked you to do so. Don't stress though; you can always update the expense later if you're unsure about the tag. Why you need pictures of receipts Most expenses include sales tax. Companies can file a claim to get this money back from the tax office. Yay for extra money! In the case of a financial audit, though, it's important to keep evidence of the sales tax - evidence which is shown on your receipts. Having a record of a card expense alone isn't enough because it doesn't show exactly what was bought and how much tax was included. In other words: please don't forget to take photos of your receipts! What to do if you forget to take a photo If you forgot to take a photo right away, you can always add one later on. In either the Pleo mobile app or web app , click on either the banner that says \"an expense needs a receipt\" or click on the expense from the list. Upload a receipt by clicking on the plus + sign. Mobile: Web: If your company is registered in France or Spain, paper receipts are only legally compliant if they are photographed via the Pleo app. Learn more here.

      "text": "This article explains all the ways that you can add a digital receipt (sent to you via email) to an expense in the Pleo app. The options are: Automatic email receipt capture with Fetch (the best way) Email Forward to Pleo (the second best way) Manual upload (the less recommended, but nevertheless easy option) Automatic email receipt capture with Fetch Fetch automatically scans your work email and automatically adds receipts from online purchases to the Pleo app. This is the best option because it is completely automated. It\u2019s also available to all Pleo customers at no additional cost. Here\u2019s how we protect your privacy and security when Fetch is enabled. How to turn on Fetch Turn on Fetch in the mobile app Go to the \"Account\" section (the icon in the bottom left corner). Tap \"Power-ups\". Flick the toggle for Fetch and follow the on-screen steps to connect a Gmail or Microsoft email account. Turn on Fetch in the web app Click on your profile in the bottom right corner. Click on \" My Account \". Click on the \"Power-ups\" tab. Click \"Enable\", then follow the on-screen steps to connect a Gmail or Microsoft email account. Considerations for your IT department Certain organisations have their own set of IT rules and filters for work emails, including settings that might block Fetch. If your organisation uses Gmail If your IT department has decided to revoke access to Fetch, this can be done from the Google Workspace admin panel . If your organisation uses Microsoft 365 Fetch works with any of Microsoft's cloud-based email services, i.e. Office 365 (Outlook) or Exchange Online. That said, employees might not have the right permission to enable a service like Fetch. There are a couple of scenarios in this case: When trying to enable Fetch via the Pleo app, the employee sees a pop-up that prompts them to automatically notify their IT admin for permission. Or The employee does not see a pop-up, in which case they need find another way to contact their IT department and request permission. As an IT administrator, we encourage you to look into your organisations' email settings prior to Fetch-related questions coming in: Set up the relevant permissions in Microsoft 365 (enabling user consent to apps). Depending on the current setup, you might also need to grant access in advance to anyone who wants to use Fetch . Please note that you need global admin rights in order to complete this step. Why Fetch is limited to a single work email Fetch is currently limited to a single work email. The reason is twofold: When it comes to connecting a private email account, there is a chance\u2014albeit a small one\u2014that Fetch will forward the wrong thing to Pleo. And that wrong thing would be visible to your organisation's Pleo admin, bookkeeper, and any of your account reviewers. So we've denied our customers this option so that this situation can never arise. When it comes to shared email accounts, supporting this functionality would violate the terms and conditions of Gmail and Outlook. So that's not something we can offer right now. Forward to Pleo This option is less automated than Fetch, but faster than manually uploading a receipt. Simply click on the email that contains your receipt, and \u201cforward\u201d it to forward@fetch.pleo.io . You do not need to have Fetch enabled to use this option. That\u2019s it! The receipt will be automatically matched to the respective card payment. The only requirement is that the receipt is sent from the email address associated with your Pleo login. If a receipt was sent to a personal email account, it needs to be sent to your work email before forwarding to Pleo. Whether you\u2019re using Fetch or Forward to Pleo, you can always set up auto-forwarding from a personal email to your work email. Here\u2019s how it works for Gmail and Outlook . On top of this, just to make life a little easier, you can forward your digital receipts directly to the Pleo app in just a few clicks. Manual upload In the Pleo web app : Go to the Expenses page. Click on the expense. Click the plus icon to add a receipt. Select a receipt from your computer. You can also choose to drag and drop into the \"Add receipt\" field: In the mobile app: Click on an expense. Upload your receipt as an image from your camera roll or as a PDF from your saved files:"

Or you have a mileage expense to handle. Well, we got you covered with Pleo Pocket. This article covers what to do when you spent your own money on something work-related, and your employer needs to reimburse you. What is Pleo Pocket? Pleo Pocket lets you keep track of money owed between an employee and the company. Add a Pocket expense in the mobile app Click the plus button in the top right-hand corner of the mobile app. Click \"Pocket\". Take a photo of your receipt or upload one from your phone's folder. Fill out the date, amount, merchant name, relevant category and/or tag. You can also include a note. Click the checkmark to save the purchase. Add a Pocket expense in the web app Go to the Expenses page in the Pleo web app. Click \"Add expense\". Click the plus button to upload a receipt or drag and drop. Fill out the amount, merchant, category, and any other info (tag, note, etc.). Click \"Save expense\". Get reimbursed through the mobile app If your Pocket expenses need to be reviewed, then you just need to wait a bit. When you see the \"Owed to you\" message in the mobile app, that means your Pocket expense has been approved for reimbursement. Please note that Pleo can only reimburse to personal cards and/or bank accounts registered in the EEA. There is a 2000 pound/euro limit per reimbursement. It's important to know that Pleo has a zero tolerance policy for facilitating transfers of any kind to sanctioned banks or individuals. To get reimbursed via bank transfer: Click on the \"Owed to you\" banner in the mobile app. Click \"Get Reimbursed\". Click \"Add bank account\": Fill out your date of birth and personal bank info. UK-based customers will be asked for a sort code and account number. All other customers will be asked for an IBAN and BIC number. You can find these numbers by logging into your bank account and looking in a section called \"details\", \"settings\", or similar. Your bank details will be automatically saved in the Pleo app for next time, unless you toggle the option off: Click \"Next.\" Fill out your address. This information will only be saved if you left the above toggle on. Click \"Add bank account\" to confirm. Click \"Reimburse\". When reimbursing to a bank account with a different currency than your company's Pleo Wallet, please note: If your account isn't set up to receive foreign currencies, the reimbursement will be rejected. So please don't hesitate to reach out to your bank and ask. Transfer times for cross-currency transactions usually take a little longer to process than same-currency transactions. Your bank might charge a fee for receiving a foreign currency. They might also apply unfavourable conversion rates, meaning that you get back a little less than what your employer reimbursed you. To reimburse yourself to a personal card: Click on the \"Owed to you\" banner in the mobile app. Click \"Get Reimbursed\". Click \"Add Personal Card\": Enter your personal card details and click \"Next\". Enter the address details related to your personal card and click \"Done\". Click \"Reimburse\". FAQs Why don't I see the plus button in my mobile app? Your Pleo admin needs to finish setting up Pocket. How can I edit an expense? If you need to edit your Pocket expense, just click on it and save any changes. You can also choose to delete the expense and start from scratch. Which cards are eligible for reimbursements?

      "text": "Sometimes you need to pay for a work expense in cash if a merchant (kiosk, taxi, etc.) doesn't accept cards. This articles covers: How to balance out a cash withdrawal by creating a Pocket expense How to account for exchange rate fluctuations How to account for a cashpoint fee Manual reimbursements when an employee has withdrawn cash How to balance out a cash withdrawal by creating a Pocket expense When you withdraw cash with your Pleo card, this affects your Pocket balance. The amount of cash with be registered as funds that you owe to your company. This is what you'll see in the mobile app: And this is what an admin (or bookkeeper) will see in their view (by going to the Pocket page and searching in the \"Outstanding\" tab): To balance this out so that you no longer owe your company, submit a Pocket expense . After submitting a Pocket expense, this is what you'll see: And the admin (or bookkeeper) view will be automatically updated as well after the you submit the Pocket expense. The \"Outstanding\" tab will automatically adjust to show a balance of zero (if the Pocket expense and cash amount match). In the example shown in these images, the Pocket expense of DKK 100 matches the cash withdrawal perfectly, meaning that the balance is zero. You don't need to create a \"perfect\" Pocket expense like this though. It's totally fine to submit multiple Pocket expenses if, for example, you're on a business trip and spend a bit of the cash on a taxi, some at a shop, etc. How to account for exchange rate fluctuations When you withdraw cash in a foreign currency, the amount will be converted as soon as your withdrawal is authorised (this usually happens within 24 hours). For example, if you withdraw 100 euro, that might show up in Pleo as about 85 pounds. You spend the cash on business costs over the next days, but in the meantime the currency exchange rate has fluctuated. So when you go to submit you Pocket expenses, the total expenses in euros work out to be, say, 83 pounds. Meaning that you still owe your company two pounds. If the exchange rate makes it look like you owe the company money, submit an additional Pocket expense that's equal to the difference. Skip adding the receipt and input \"currency conversion\" in place of the store or merchant: If the difference is positive (e.g., it looks like you spent 87 pounds rather than 85), an admin (or bookkeeper) can resolve the difference by clicking \"Settle balance\" and selecting \"Other\" as the reimbursement method: How to account for a cashpoint fee If a cashpoint fee is added, create a separate Pocket expense for the fee and upload a picture of the cashpoint receipt. Input \"cashpoint fee\" or \"ATM fee\" in place of the store or merchant. Manual reimbursements when an employee has withdrawn cash If an employee has either withdrawn cash or marked an expense as personal, the manual reimbursement options change. Specifically, an admin or bookkeeper will need to settle the an employee's entire Pocket balance (instead of select Pocket expenses): This is due to a current limitation on Pleo's side. Please stay tuned for future updates! Once an employee's previous Pocket expenses have been exported and reconciled in your accounting system, their balance will be re-set in Pleo, and it will be possible to manually select specific expenses for reimbursement again (like this):"

In the list you can keep track of the total distance driven per team member. When your team member adds the mileage expense that brings them over the threshold, they're automatically prompted to update their rate. The total is reset at the beginning of the financial year.

How to submit a per diem claim The per diem amount is automatically calculated by Pleo according to the local regulations. Different rates apply depending on where you\u2019re traveling. Please note that you can only submit a claim once your trip is over. Log into the Pleo mobile app . Click the plus button in the top right-hand corner. Click Per diem . Input the locations and dates for the beginning and end of your business trip. If any meals were included in your airfare, accommodation, or events that you attend, please tick those off.

For German customers, it's a 20% (breakfast) or 40% (lunch/dinner) deduction of that day's per diem rate. For Swedish customers, it's a 15% (20% if travelling within Sweden) or 35% (lunch/dinner) deduction. As per legal requirements, meal deductions are always calculated based on a full day's per diem rate (even if someone travels for less than 24 hours).

Therefore, we have created a feature for this in Pleo! How can I use Pleo for Wellness? You can use both your Pleo card and make Pocket expenses for Wellness expenses and keep track of your budget; it is linked to your company's Wellness category . See budget before purchase: Go to Profile at the bottom right of the app. Click on \"Friskv\u00e5rd\" in the menu. Here you see your own budget status; how much has already been used and how much is left until the end of the year. Click in the Budget box to see which purchases have been made previously. Report Wellness expenses: Pay with Pleo card or create a Pocket expense. Select the Category you use for Wellness/Friskv\u00e5rd. The budget meter is updated and shows how the purchase fits to the budget. The meter is green if the purchase is within budget, and red if the purchase is over budget. Pocket expenses can be edited to a lower amount if the purchase is over budget. Review Wellness expenses: Reviewers can see their team's Wellness expenses and their budget. The meter is green if the purchase is within budget, and red if the purchase is over budget. The person in charge of the Review can easily see whether Wellness expenses are within or over budget, and mark the expenses accordingly in Pleo. Frequently asked questions about Wellness Can I use both Pleo cards and Pocket for Wellness expenses? Yes, both work well and count towards the same budget. The budget is linked to the Category you use for Health Care, regardless of whether you pay with a Pleo card or report expenses via Pocket. Can we set different budgets for different employees? Yes, by creating a \"Custom Budget\" in Friskv\u00e5rd settings. Custom budgets can be useful for e.g. part-time employees, mid-year hires, and employees who have spent part of their Wellness allowance outside of Pleo. For which period is the Wellness budget calculated? Wellness allowance is calculated during the calendar year, 1 January - 31 December. The budget resets on 1 January for all users you have in Pleo. The period cannot be changed. Can Admins get a report on all Wellness expenses?

It's always possible to adjust anyone's limits if larger purchases become more common or if total expenses increase. This article explains: Who can set and adjust spending limits How to set and adjust spending limits How cardholders can view their limits Who can set spending limits?

Click on \"Limits.\" This is where you can change the monthly and/or per-purchase limit: You can set two types of spending limits: Card limit: This can be either a \"monthly\" (calendar month) or \"total\" (calendar year). This is a \"soft\" limit, meaning that it's only possible to go over once before the cards are disabled. Let's say my monthly limit is 500 pounds per month and I've already spent 450. If I try to spend 51 pounds, it will work even though I've exceeded my monthly limit by 1 pound. The logic here is that you don't want limits to inconvenience people who need to use their cards. If someone is consistently overshooting their monthly limit, you can always have a chat with them and/or adjust their per purchase limit. Limit per purchase : This refers to any single purchase. This is a \"hard\" limit, meaning that any payment over this amount is automatically declined. All cards (physical and/or virtual) are disabled when limits are reached. Cards with monthly spending limits are re-enabled at the beginning of each calendar month. Cards with total spending limits are re-enabled if the spending limits can be increased or reset manually.

For organisations registered in the UK and the Canary Islands Your invoices with show 0% VAT due to trade regulations. For organisations registered in Denmark Your invoices (under the Billing page in Pleo) will include 25% VAT. For organisations registered in other EU countries Pleo operates under the EU's One-Stop-Shop schemes, and offers reverse charge VAT , also called intra-Community supply. With Reverse Charge VAT, no VAT is charged by Pleo. Instead, your company needs to report VAT to the local authorities. We can offer your company Reverse charge VAT if the following conditions are met: your company is registered for VAT in another Member State that isn\u2019t Denmark (where Pleo Technologies A/S is registered) your company has registered a valid VAT registration number (including country prefix) To qualify for Reverse Charge VAT, simply make sure that you have provided a valid VAT number (under Billing details ): Note: In some cases, you may need to take additional steps (see below) to qualify for reverse charge VAT. For organisations registered in Spain (and other countries where extra steps are required) In some countries, such as Spain, your organisation must perform an additional step to be eligible for reverse charge VAT (i.e.,\"intra-community\" supply of services). In Spain, to qualify for inversi\u00f3n de sujeto pasivo , you need to submit the Modelo 036 form, resulting in a document titled \"Acuerdo de alta en el registro de operadores intracomunitarios.\" You don't need to send Pleo this type of document before we remove the VAT from your Billing. However, if you have taken the required steps to qualify for reverse charge VAT after signing up to Pleo, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can perform a manual check on your eligibility. If you do not inform us of a change in your VAT status, you may need to wait up to 3 months for the change to be correctly reflected."

This article covers: What happens if you send funds from the wrong account How to top-up your Wallet Pleo's bank account details How long it takes for funds to arrive What happens if you send funds from the wrong account As a regulated financial services institution, Pleo has some rules about your Wallet 's source of funds. We can accept funds sent from: An EEA or UK business account registered in the same company name as your Pleo account. E-money institutions where the original sender details are readable and match the company name in your Pleo account. We cannot accept funds sent from: A personal bank account. A payment or e-money institution where the original sender details are unreadable or do not match your account name. As per Pleo's Master Service Agreement , we also reserve the right to refuse any transfer for compliance reasons. So what happens if you've accidentally sent funds from the wrong account? Pleo will send the funds back. It can take up to seven business days for the refund to be processed. Sometimes we need to get proof of transfer (PDF downloaded from your online banking) before sending the funds back. If that's the case, we'll reach out to your Pleo admin via email. How to top-up your Wallet Go to the \" Wallet \". Click on \"Top-up\". A pop-up screen will show you transfer details for sending funds to Pleo Good to know: The account information is unique to your company. When you make the transfer you can leave the reference field empty or enter your company\u2019s name. The daily Wallet limit (i.e., how much you're able to send to Pleo at a time/per day) are: 30,000 GBP / 30,000 EUR / 275,000 DKK / 322,500 SEK. As soon as the funds hit our partner\u2019s bank account, they will be automatically linked to your Pleo wallet and you will receive an e-mail informing that your Pleo wallet has been topped up. In some cases we may need to ask for more information from you, in order to top up your funds. Pleo's Bank Account Details: Name: Pleo Financial Services A/S Address: Ravnsborg Tv\u00e6rgade 5C, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark For the UK: Bank Name: JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. Bank Address: 25 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London E14 5JP For Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain: Name: J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. Address:  6, route de Tr\u00e8ves, L-2633 Senningerberg, Luxembourg, For Denmark and Sweden: Bank Name: Danske Bank Bank Address: Holmens Kanal 2-12, 1092 Copenhagen K, Denmark For Germany (verified customers): Name: J.P. Morgan Address: Junghofstrasse 14, Frankfurt am Main, 60311, Germany How long it takes funds to arrive Your first Wallet load can take up to several bank days to arrive, as Pleo needs to complete an initial verification of your bank account. Once that's done, here's when you can expect funds to arrive within your Pleo Wallet: UK Open banking (instant transfer) This option usually takes a few minutes, but can take up to about one hour. It is available 24 hours a day, including weekends. Open banking is the option that appears when an admin clicks \"top up\" in the Wallet page: There is a \u00a312,000 limit per open banking top-up (but you can make more than one top-up per day). Please go through the Pleo web app to top-up with open banking (going through your online banking instead of Pleo can cause some problems with the transfer reference). Pleo's recipient details for open banking look different than the transfer details when choosing one of the alternative top-up methods (see below). This is because Pleo's open banking account details have 24/7 support, whereas the others are limited to bank days. If you want to choose one of the below transfer methods instead, click the \"bank transfer details\" (red text showing in the above image). Faster Payments Funds will usually arrive within 20 minutes, but can take up to 2 hours (only on bank days). CHAPS Transfer Funds will arrive on the same day if sent before 17:40, usually within 3 hours (only during banking hours). Auto top up Not available in the UK. Denmark Straksoverf\u00f8rsel: Funds will arrive within 60 seconds (all days of the year). Sammedagsoverf\u00f8rsel: Funds will arrive the same day if sent before 11:30 (only on bank days). If sent after 11:30, funds will arrive on the following bank day. Auto top-up: Funds will arrive within 1-3 banks days. Sweden Same-Day Transfer: Funds will usually arrive within 4 hours, but at the latest the will arrive on the following bank day (only on bank days). Standard SEK Transfer: Funds will arrive by the following bank day (only on bank days). Auto top-up: Funds will arrive within 1-3 banks days. Euro currency countries SEPA Credit Transfer: Funds usually arrive on the same day if sent before 12:00. At the latest, they will arrive by the end of the next banking day (only on bank days). Please note that Pleo only support's SEPA Core, as that's a lot easier to set up (i.e., you won't be asked for a creditor identifier number or anything like that). SEPA Instant: Not available/not supported. Funds sent with this method will bounce back. Auto top-up: Funds will arrive within 1-3 banks days. Open banking for the Netherlands: between 1 hour and 1 bank day."

      "text": "This article is for both: Customers who are in the process of topping up their Pleo Wallet for the first time, and we need some more information about your source of funds. Customers who have transferred to their Pleo Wallet before, but now: Have made a transfer from a new account, or Are registered in Sweden, and have reached a top-up threshold for which we need more information (please scroll down to the section \"If your organisation is based in Sweden and has reached a top-up threshold\"). Requirements for sending funds to Pleo Pleo is a regulated financial institution. As such, we need to keep our customers' money safe. It's a legal obligation. It's also the decent thing to do. Part of keeping customers' money safe is knowing who is sending funds to a Pleo Wallet . According to our \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) policy, Pleo can only accept transfers from: An EEA or UK business account registered in the same company name as your Pleo account. E-money institutions where the original sender details are readable and match the company name in your Pleo account. If Pleo receives funds that obviously do not meet the above requirements, we simply send it straight back (meaning it's never visible in a Pleo Wallet). However, in less clear-cut cases, our compliance team might contact you. Why is our compliance team contacting you? There are cases where it's hard to gauge if the above-listed sender requirements are met. In such instances, our team will reach out to an admin of your Pleo account. So if you see an email from wallet@pleo.io , that's us. If you have any doubts or concerns, please feel free to contact our support team to double-check that the email is legit. For anyone curious, our Data Protection Agreement can be here . What we'll ask for We'll ask for a document from your online banking (in PDF, PNG, or JPEG format, please!) that includes your organisation's sender bank account number and full organisation name. If we cannot see your full bank account name When this happens, we simply don't know if the name of your bank account matches the name of your Pleo account. This can happen in a few different scenarios: It's your first-ever Wallet top-up. You've changed bank accounts . And although this isn't your first top-up ever, it's the first one from your new account. You haven't changed bank accounts, but you're a UK-based customer who's trying out an open banking top-up for the first time. We'll usually contact the longest-standing admin of your account (not always though) to ask for the above-mentioned document. If your organisation is based in Sweden and has reached a top-up threshold Initial verification is done automatically for our Swedish customers, so we won't reach out because of missing sender info. However, once your organisation reaches a spending threshold, we need to reach out to all of your Pleo account admins to ask for the above-mentioned document (showing a clearing number and account number). The threshold is different depending on the organisation, so we unfortunately can't share an exact number with you. If we don't get the doc from each admin within 11 business days, regulations dictate that a spending block be applied to your Pleo account and only unblocked once the documentation is provided. We really don't want to do that. So please help us help you by sending the documents over as soon as you can. Thanks so much for reading! You've been very patient. Once your bank account has been verified in any of the above cases, future transfers from the same account won\u2019t be subject to this check. In other words, we hopefully won't have to bother you again. We're looking forward to receiving any requested documentation, and promptly sending the funds through to your Pleo Wallet."

Export your invoices - along with other Pleo expenses - to your accounting system (Xero, Quickbooks, DATEV Unternehmen online, and more). How to get started This functionality is currently available in the UK and Germany. Click on \" Invoices \" within the main menu. Select \"enable invoices\" to generate a forwarding email. You'll then see an email (like the one circled below) that you can share with your colleagues so that they can forward invoices to Pleo: Your colleagues will also be able to upload an invoice using Pleo's mobile app. Simply click the plus icon in the top right corner, then follow the on-screen instructions: How it works Pleo scans the uploaded (or email forwarded) invoice. The invoice will now be in the invoices inbox ready to be approved and paid. If any information is missing from the invoice (e.g., due date), then the Pleo admin will be prompted to fill that out so that the invoice is moved to the scheduled queue. Managing and paying invoices As an admin, you can go to your invoices inbox and select the invoice you wish to review and pay. Bookkeepers (with extended access) can view invoices, but only admins can pay them. The only exception is if you're a partner bookkeeper , in which case clients can grant your access to pay invoices on their behalf. From here you can view both the invoice PDF (left) and the payment details (right) simultaneously. 3. There are three stages to paying an invoice: Processed : Uploaded and information populated Awaiting Approval : After viewing the details you can approve or reject the invoice Ready for payment: Once approve and set the payment date and click ' Pay ' 4. The expense will now sit in the scheduled tab in your invoices page 5. Once the expense is paid the funds will be taken from your Pleo wallet. An invoice that is scheduled for a specific date will get paid at 1 PM (UK time) on the day. If an invoice is set up to be \"paid now,\" it will be paid immediately. How invoices work with your accounting integration Right now, Invoices integrate with Xero , Quickbooks , and DATEV Unternehmen Online . Invoices are also compatible with Pleo's Sage 50 integration as well as our custom and generic export format. Once an invoice has been uploaded, it will automatically end up in the Unexported queue. Once you move an invoice to the Export queue, it will be locked. Once Exported, the invoice will be fully synced with the aforementioned accounting systems.

Good to know: for admins and bookkeepers When reviewing invoices in Pleo, please keep in mind that: The supplier name must match the name of the recipient account.

This means the transaction has been authorised for that amount, but it is still awaiting the merchant's confirmation or reversal and the amount can change once it is settled. This is a normal practice for all credit/debit cards, and so although Pleo makes the process a lot more visible it is nothing to worry about! A pending transaction can occur in the following scenarios: When you use your Pleo card on e.g. petrol, hotels, or rental cars, certain merchants may ask us to authorise the transaction before you have completed the purchase. In such cases, it serves like a security deposit. When the transaction is finalised and settled, the amount will likely change and be deducted from your Pleo wallet balance. Such transaction can be pending for up to 30 days. When the transaction on your Pleo card is pending further processing. In most of the cases, transactions are processed overnight and will be completed in the following business day. However, sometimes it can take a few days for the merchant to complete the transaction; in this case purchases will appear as pending until the transaction is completed, or for up to five days. Certain merchants such as Uber or DriveNow may authorise small charges to your card to test the response and make sure the card account is legitimate. These authorisations will be reversed and the money will never leave your account, however this may take a few days to disappear depending on how and when the merchant processes the reversal."

This article explains: What Cashback is What Cashback looks like in the Pleo app How to sign up for Cashback What is Cashback? With Cashback, your company receives a percentage of the money spent with Pleo cards. Cashback is 0.5%-1%, depending on your Pleo plan, with the limit being the price of your subscription. For example, if you pay \u00a335 per month for the Essential plan, the monthly Cashback limit is \u00a335. Cashback is calculated once per month based on settled card payments. Any pending transactions move to the next month's Cashback calculations. Cashback does not include funds spent on Invoices, Pocket reimbursements, or similar. What Cashback looks like in the Pleo app Cashback will appear in your Pleo Wallet once per month. For example, for settled Pleo card expenses from January, Cashback will be paid out within the first five business days of February. This is assuming that your billing period is from the start to the end of a given month. Cashback will look the same as a refund, and Pleo will automatically attach a receipt for bookkeeping purposes. How to sign up for Cashback Cashback is for you if: Your Pleo account is registered in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, or Sweden. Your Pleo account is on a long-term (e.g., yearly) Essential or Advanced plan . You won't find a sign-up button for Cashback in the Pleo app. Instead, talk to your account manager about having Cashback added to your Pleo plan. Don't know who your account manager is?

Account switching in Pleo's web app Log into any one of your accounts. Click on your profile in the bottom left corner.

      "text": "Sometimes paying with a card doesn't cut it. You might find yourself in a taxi that doesn't take card payments. Or you want to be reimbursed for having used your own car for a work trip. For situations likes these, we got you covered with Pleo Pocket. What is Pleo Pocket? Pleo Pocket lets you keep track of money owed between an employee and the company. How to enable Pleo Pocket Please keep in mind that it's not possible for an admin to deactivate Pocket once it's been enabled. In the Pleo web app, click \" Pocket \". Click \"Learn more\". Follow the on-screen steps to complete the set up. Enabling Pocket also enables access to Per Diem (currently available in Germany and Sweden) and Mileage (available for all countries). How to submit a Pocket expense Whether you're an employee or an admin who's spent their own money on something work-related, here's how to submit a Pocket expense and get reimbursed. Who can see Pocket expenses? Admins can see all Pocket expenses. External bookkeepers (limited and extended) can see Pocket expenses. They can also settle Pocket balances if that permission has not been disabled . Employees can only see their own Pocket expenses. Unless they're a reviewer . How to track and review Pocket expenses Pocket expenses appear in two places: the Expenses page and the Pocket page. The Expenses page is where you can make any changes (e.g., change the category) to a Pocket expense, just as you would for a regular card expense. The Pocket page is where you get an overview of the settled versus outstanding expenses for each employee. Every employee has a Pocket balance based on the accumulation of expenses submitted or owed (\"owed\" if they withdraw cash ). Expenses still awaiting review will not be added to the balance owed until it has been approved. How can I reimburse a Pocket expense? Personal bank account or card reimbursements Enable direct reimbursements by clicking on the feature in the Pocket page : When setting up this option, Pleo will nudge you to set up any review thresholds. Follow those steps if you want to approve Pocket expenses before someone can reimburse themselves to a personal bank account or card. Once enabled, employees can reimburse themselves by going through the steps in the mobile app. There is a 2000 GBP/euro limit per reimbursement. Settle the balance manually If you've decided to settle a Pocket balance outside of Pleo (e.g., along with an employee's salary), here's what to do: In the Pleo web app, go to the Pocket page. Click on the employee whose balance needs to be settled. Click on \"Settle Balance\" and choose a payment method: This will be recorded in the \" Export \" page as a line item to ensure that Pocket expenses are balanced out in your accounting system. If an employee has either withdrawn cash or marked an expense as personal, your manual reimbursement options change. Specifically, an admin or bookkeeper will need to settle the an employee's entire Pocket balance (instead of select Pocket expenses): This is due to a current limitation on Pleo's side. Please stay tuned for future updates! Once an employee's previous Pocket expenses have been exported and reconciled in your accounting system, their balance will be re-set in Pleo, and it will be possible to manually select specific expenses for reimbursement again (like this): How to export Pocket expenses Depending on your chosen accounting system, Pocket expenses and reimbursements can be exported directly along with Pleo card expenses. Learn how exporting works. Reimbursements will show up in your \" Export \" page as \"Pocket transfers\": Once exported, this line will reflect a movement of funds from your Pleo Wallet account to your Pleo Pocket account in your accounting system. FAQs Can an admin trigger a direct reimbursement? Once a Pocket expense has been submitted (and reviewed as okay, if relevant), it's up to the employee to reimburse themselves to their bank account or personal card. But admins cannot trigger a bank account or card reimbursement. Why not? A few practical reasons are that: The employee might not have added their personal bank account or card info yet. The info has been entered, but the bank account or card has since expired. The bank that's connected to the card might send out a push notification before letting a card reimbursement through. With these things in mind, it makes sense to put the onus on the employee. If an employee owes the company money (e.g., they paid with their Pleo card and then marked the expense as personal), how is this resolved? It's not currently possible to, for example, take money from the employee's personal card. As an admin or bookkeeper managing Pocket expenses, in this scenario you can choose to: Wait until the employee submits a Pocket expense that negates the money they owe to the company, or Settle the balance outside of Pleo (e.g., deducting what's owed from a pay slip). Are there any fees involved with reimbursements? There is a transaction fee of 0.9% of the amount with a max of 1 GBP per reimbursement (i.e., whichever is lower will be the fee).

We designed Pocket to be a great partner for finance teams, so we\u2019re making some adjustments to help them better visualise company outgoings. What\u2019s changing? From the 30th of September, every time an admin reimburses via Pocket, they\u2019ll select the exact expense that they want to settle, and the link between the reimbursement and the expense will be visualised in the Pocket page. We\u2019re also adding more filters so you can see each employee\u2019s settled and unsettled expenses. What if an employee reimburses themselves? When employees choose to reimburse themselves, they reimburse all pocket expenses in their balance. This means it\u2019s easy for us to connect the expenses with the reimbursement amount. Do you need to do anything? We recommend you reimburse employees with outstanding balances who aren\u2019t using direct reimbursements before the 30th September.

It usually takes just a few minutes for an open banking top-up to appear in Pleo, but it can take up to about an hour. In the Netherlands , open banking is the same as a SEPA Credit Transfer. So while it's not necessarily faster than a manual Wallet top-up , it involves fewer steps. Depending on your bank, an open banking transfer to a Netherlands-based Pleo account can take anywhere from one hour to one business day, and is not supported during evenings or weekends. How to top up your Wallet using open banking Admins and bookkeepers with advanced Wallet permissions can go through the following steps: In the Pleo web app, click on the Wallet page. Click \"Top-up\": For customers in both the UK and the Netherlands, Open banking is the default option you see. Select your bank from the list and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the transfer: Good to know (UK and the Netherlands): There is a \u00a312,000 / \u20ac15,000 limit per open banking top-up (but you can make more than one top-up per day). Please go through the Pleo web app to top up with open banking (going through your online banking instead of Pleo can cause some problems with the transfer reference). Good to know (UK only): Pleo's recipient details for open banking look different than the transfer details when choosing one of the alternative top-up methods (see below). The reason is that Pleo's open banking account details have 24/7 support, whereas the others are limited to bank days. Currently, Silicon Valley Bank does not support top-ups outside working hours. We sometimes get cases of our customers' banks blocking an open banking top-up. If the funds still haven't come through after more than an hour, please contact your bank. The alternative to open banking is a \"regular\" transfer to Pleo via Faster Payments and Chaps transfer . Simply follow the same steps as above, switching to a regular transfer by clicking \"bank transfer details\" at the bottom of the \"Select your bank\" panel. Barclays customers: If you find you have an issue with using Barclays for Open Banking, there are two things to consider: Barclays Business or Barclays Corporate are the only Barclays options that support open banking . Make sure to select one of these. If you receive an error after selecting one of the above, you will need to update your third party permissions on barclays.net"

The Withdraw function is accessible to admins and bookkeepers with advanced Wallet permission . Once you initiate a withdrawal, all Pleo account admins will receive two emails. The first email goes out once you have submitted the withdrawal form, and the second once Pleo sends the funds back. For the UK and euro currency countries Go to your \" Wallet .\" Click on \"Withdraw\". Enter the amount to send back The bank account details in the withdrawal form are pre-filled according to the source of the Wallet funds. If you have used more than one business bank account to send funds to Pleo, you will be able to select the preferred account from a dropdown list. Click \"Next\". Click \"Confirm withdrawal\". Once submitted, the funds will arrive in your company's bank account within 1-3 business days. For Denmark and Sweden The process is similar to the above steps for UK and euro currency countries. The only differences are due to specific banking regulations in Denmark and Sweden: For Danish customers, the funds will be transferred back to the bank account associated with your company's CVR number. If you need the funds to be sent to a new account, we'll first need to whitelist said account. Please do a manual top-up (the amount can be 1 DKK) from the new account . Once received, the new account will appear as an option when withdrawing funds. For Swedish customers, business bank account details need to be entered manually, along with a bank statement confirming the details: For both Danish and Swedish accounts, it can take up to 7 business days for the funds to arrive in your business bank account."

The only requirement is that the organisation name registered to your new bank account matches the name of your organisation's Pleo account. The first time you manually top-up your Pleo Wallet from the new bank account, it will take up to 24 hours longer than normal for the funds to show up. Once we've cleared your new bank account, future top-ups will work as fast as normal. If you use auto top-up Please note that auto top-up is not currently available to our UK-based customers. Here's what to do if you have enabled auto top-up and are changing your bank account. If your organisation is based in a euro currency country: Please complete a manual top-up from your new bank account. Our team will take up to 24 hours extra to clear your new account as the approved source of funds. Remove the existing direct debit agreement agreement: Go to the Wallet page. Click \"Top-up\" and then \"Direct Debit\": Click \"Edit\": Click \"Delete agreement\". After you delete the old agreement, you will be prompted to set up a new auto top-up agreement. Your new bank account will automatically appear in the dropdown menu as soon as it's been approved. So you can select it for your new auto top-up agreement, as in this example: If your organisation is based in Denmark: Please cancel your current auto top-up agreement here and then submit a new one here . When asked for a \"aftaleleverand\u00f8rnummer\" (English: supplier number), please enter Pleo's CVR number, which is 36538686. If your organisation is based in Sweden: Please cancel the autogiro agreement for your old bank account (your former bank will need to help you with this).

But certain people would likely need to access both entities to approve and track spending. This is where Multi-Entity Management comes in. With multi-entity access, admins can access multiple Pleo entities without needing to use alias emails. This is particularly useful for finance teams who manage spending across entities. This article explains: How to get started with Multi-Entity Management Which user roles have access to the different entities How to create a multi-entity team How to get started with Multi-Entity Management As outlined on our pricing page : The Essential plan lets you connect two entities. The Advanced plan lets you connect an unlimited number of entities. Interested? Ask your dedicated customer success manager to turn this functionality on for your accounts. Not sure who your customer success manager is? Get in touch with our support team and they'll connect you to the right person. Which user roles have access to the different entities Admins are the only ones who get the full overview of different entities. Once the functionality has been enabled for two or more entities, all admins from said entities will be able to easily switch between them: Log onto the Pleo web app . Click your profile image in the bottom left corner. Click on another entity to switch views: While admins will have access across entities, their own Pleo card(s) and respective expenses will be connected to a single entity. In the above image, you can see that Gustaf's Pleo entity at the top of the list. You can change someone from \"employee\" to \"admin\" by: Going to the People section. Clicking on the person's name. Ticking the Admin (Multi-entity) box: While employees cannot see or toggle between entities, they can benefit from multi-entity teams (explained below). How to create a multi-entity team With multi-entity comes multi-entity teams and reviewing, meaning that it's possible to review expenses for a team that's working from different countries and locations. Once multi-entity is enabled, simply set up a team as you normally would (with the exception that you can add people from all entities). You'll get a prompt to confirm that you want the team to be multi-entity: Anyone can be on a multi-entity team and be a reviewer of a multi-entity team; even if their role is employee and not admin. A reviewer can see expenses from a multi-entity team using their usual login credentials, without having to switch back and forth."

Here's how the latter method works: Before re-importing, edit a tag if the spreadsheet contains any changes for one of the columns for a tag. Add new tags to the existing spreadsheet and re-import. This will automatically update the sheet by archiving old tags and adding new ones. \ud83d\udca1 Tip:  When you re-import, make sure that the column names are the same as the ones in the tag group.

Keep in mind that: Tag groups that are in use can only be archived, not deleted. You can have a maximum of three active tag groups but unlimited archived tag groups. Archived tag groups still show up on exports and within accounting integrations. Employees cannot see archived tag groups when submitting an expense. How to highlight a tag group You can now ensure that employees complete their expenses by highlighting a needed tag group. When creating a new group, toggle on Highlight this tag group (it will appear on the right hand side). Once set up, the mobile app will highlight the missing field within the expense.

Correct usage of the export feature will help you avoid bookkeeping issues and mistakes further down the line. Simply downloading expenses from Pleo will not move your expenses to your accounting system (unless you are using the custom format or similar file system). The three stages of a Pleo expense Once a card purchase or Pocket expense is registered, it should move through the following stages: Unexported: This is where settled expenses sit whilst you complete any verification or changes. This is the only stage of the three where expenses can be amended. Export queue: Once added to the export queue, expenses are no longer editable. Here you can double check the data is correct and remove from the queue if any changes need to be made. Exported: This where you view any expenses that have been exported to your accounting system. You can also export them again if necessary. How to export expenses First, make sure you have set up the integration with your accounting system prior to exporting. If you have not done this, you can do it on the \" Settings \" page. Go to the \" Export \" page. Need to make changes to expenses before exporting? You can edit one by one or in bulk. You can use the filters in the top-right corner to find all expenses connected to a date range, account number, whether or not a receipt is missing, etc. You can also use the search field to filter based on vendor name. To make changes to multiple expenses at a time, click \"Select All\", \"Bulk Edit\", and \"Appl y\" . Move expenses from \"Unexported\" to the \"Export queue\" when you are confident everything is correct. Click on \"Export\" to send all selected expenses to your accounting system. How to view your export history Want to check what was exported, when, and by whom? Here's how: Go to the \" Exported \" tab. Click \"Export History\". Click on an export from the list, which includes the date, time, and person triggered the export. Click \"Confirm\". Good to know It's only possible to export expenses that have been presented (i.e, where the merchant has claimed the funds). Pleo automatically pre-selects expenses for exporting. The expense criteria is to have an account number and a receipt attached. When expenses are moved from \"Unexported\" to the \"Export queue\", they are locked and cannot be changed by anyone unless you moved them back to  \"Unexported\". Once exported, the expense will stay locked. You can re-export expenses that have been exported previously. Related articles Best practices of exporting"

This is why we generally recommend that you use the export function whenever possible, even if you are using a .csv or custom format. This doesn't move anything or change anything in Pleo. Exporting is what you do when Pleo expenses have been approved and you move them over so that they are locked (no longer editable). How to download expenses Go to the Wallet page from the Export menu. Select and apply any filter. Download a .csv or Excel file."

      "text": "When you pay for multiple items and/or services at the same time, different VAT rates might apply. Certain items or services might've also been dedicated to different projects. For example, an invoice from a translation agency might include translation services for your marketing team and sales team. The good news is that Pleo lets you split card expenses so that your company can: Claim back the appropriate amount of VAT Better organise financial reports based on specific tags (representing different projects, teams, etc.) This article explains: How to split an expense if you're an employee How to split an expense if you're a Pleo admin or bookkeeper How to split an expense if you're an employee If you're not sure which tags apply to a particular company expense, reach out to your manager or finance team outside of Pleo. In the Pleo mobile app, go to the expenses section (second icon from the left at the bottom of your screen). Click on an expense. If you haven't already, add the first tag. Click  the plus sign \u2018 + \u2019 next to the first tag. Select one or more tags. Adjust the amounts if needed (Pleo automatically divides the total charge by the number of tags). Click \"Done\". How to split an expense if you're a Pleo admin or bookkeeper In the Pleo web app, go to the \" Export \" page. Click on an expense in the list. Click on \"Split expense\". Once you've split the expense based on account and associated tax code, the changes are automatically saved. Once finished, export the expense to see what it looks like in your accounting system. Good to know: If you split an expense in Pleo, it will show up when you export to any of the following accounting systems: e-conomic Xero SIE file Datev Sage 50 Sage 200 Dinero Billy Generic format When splitting an expense, you'll see a top line and an empty second line. The top line represents the original expense in terms of amount, category and tax rate. This cannot be edited. The category and tax rate of the second and any additional lines will mimic whatever the top line shows. Inputting an amount in any new line will automatically deduct from the amount in the top line. If you delete a line, the first line will automatically adjust. If you delete the split, the expense info will revert to its original description. If anyone else in the company (e.g., another admin or the cardholder) changes the category of a split expense, this will be reflected in the category of the top line. When you export the expense, it will show up in your accounting system in multiple lines, all with the same receipt number and additional data. Only the amount, category/account number and tax (amount, code, rate depending on format) will vary depending on your changes made. If an employee has already added multiple tags to an expense, you'll be able to see that when clicking on an expense in the Export page. An employee can only add multiple tags from the same tag group . Admins and bookkeepers can add tags from different groups, but then the employee can no longer edit the tags. Employees can only split expenses by selecting Tags (i.e.,cost centers). They don't have access to editing the VAT and categories; but admins and bookkeepers can do that in the Export page (as explained above). After the expense has been processed, the edit options disappears for the employee."

      "text": "In order to directly export Pleo expenses to your accounting system, you already have one account number set up. With Pocket we introduce 2 more accounts: The Pocket account. This is the account that will represent the balance between the company and all its employees. The default reimbursement account. This is a temporary account number for reimbursements and cash returns that we assign by default. Step 1: create the Pocket accounts In the Pleo web app, go to your Accounting settings Find the Pocket setup banner Follow the steps and input the numbers of the accounts If you are using an integration to Xero or Quickbooks: the setting up is easy as when you enable it - the pocket accounts are created automatically If you are using any of the CSV formats, you will need to hop into your chart of accounts and create the two new accounts. Step 2: Export Pocket transactions and reimbursements There are two type of entries to be aware of with pocket. First the actual expense will be categorised like your other expenses. Instead of spending from the Wallet Account, it will spend from the Pocket account. Here is an example from the view in Xero: The second one is the reimbursement to the employee. You will be able to export this reimbursement as a transaction from your Reimbursement account to your Pocket account. Below you can see what the flow looks like. To export the reimbursement to your accounting system: Click on Export Select the reimbursement transaction you wish to export Add it to the Export Queue Go to your Export Queue (in the top middle) and click on Export You have now exported this transaction. It will show up as a positive balance on your Pleo Pocket account and you can match it with the actual reimbursement (bank transfer, payroll or cash handout) that was made. Step 3: Balancing your books with Pocket If your employee reported a pocket expense late Sometimes your employees might add mileage or pocket expenses from three months ago and you might have closed that month already. You can easily edit the purchase date with pocket expenses. When changing the purchase date: The expense will move under the new purchase date in the Export -page after refreshing and The expense will be reported under the new purchase date The Pocket balance report will use the new date The Activity feed of the expense will make a mark of the change"

      "text": "Pleo deals with two kinds of transactions: authorisations and presentments. We display them differently for admins and users, and it is understandable if things seem a bit confusing. Allow us to explain the difference. The Expenses page in Pleo displays transactions according to the date of authorisation . This is the date that the transaction was made, and is accessible by both admins and users. The Export page will show transactions according to the date of presentment . (also known as settled) This is only available to admins. Let's dive in further: Authorisations: When you make a purchase, the funds are \"reserved\" in your bank account with plans to clear. This is called an authorisation. Often the transaction will settle within a day, i.e. become a presentment, barring any disputes or currency conversion. In Pleo, pending expenses are authorisations. The date of authorisation will also help you distinguish between Monday's latte and Tuesday's latte from the same retailer Presentments/Settled Transactions: Once the money actually leaves your bank account, the amount is called a presentment. This is the actual, final charge for that transaction. Bookkeepers love this stuff, they can't get enough of actual presentment value and date. That is why all exports from Pleo will list transactions according to the date of presentment, not authorisation. Note: If an authorisation does not graduate to a presentment within 10 days, we receive a reversal of the authorisation and the expense will disappear from Pleo. If you have any questions regarding authorisations and presentments, contact us on support ."

However when you export your expenses or download a balance statement , the settled time is converted into UTC . Just to give you an example, let's say there is an expense with time zones as follows.

Pleo does not currently support Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Please contact our support team if the below instructions do not work for you. This might be the case if you\u2019ve customised your Business Central setup. This article covers: What to do before you connect Pleo and Business Central How to connect The data that syncs between Pleo and Business Central Before you connect Pleo to Business Central If you need your Pleo card expenses to have a contra account automatically assigned, create a contra account (also known as a Balancing Account Number) in Business Central. This needs to be a G/L account. If you're using Pleo Pocket , you can also create an additional contra account for reimbursements. Need to create a new General Journal Template in Business Central to base your Pleo Journals on? If so, there\u2019s a little quirk. The new template you create has to come first alphabetically in the list of general templates. Let's say you name your journal \"Pleo\" and there is another general journal template called \"Kasse.\" Rename the Pleo journal template so that it comes first alphabetically (e.g., \"APleo\") in the list of General Journal Templates. Connect Pleo and Business Central Log into the Pleo app and go to \" Settings \". Click \" Accounting \". Select \"Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\" from the list. You will be prompted to connect your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central account with Pleo on a separate page. Log in and click \"Allow access\". Back in the Accounting page in Pleo, double check that you've selected an \"Integration Environment\", \"Integration Company\", \"Pleo Journal\", and \"Account for Pleo Expenses\". The first three of these are shown in the below video. However, the additional \"Account for Pleo Expenses\" is a new field. This is where you should input the G/L account that your created in Business Central. What data is synced between Pleo and Business Central? \"Categories\" in Pleo reflect your chart of accounts in Business Central. When you set up your categories after enabling the integration, the drop-down menu in Pleo will automatically reflect your account numbers in Business Central. That said, you will need to give the specific category (account number) a name. The name should be easy for employees to recognise when they assign details to their Pleo purchases. \"Tags\" in Pleo reflect your dimensions in Business Central.

Read more about the configuration here . Have accounts, tax rates, and categories ready Ask your tax consultant which account (Kasse) number is available for Pleo expenses. The consultant will provide an available number by cross checking the general ledger account (German: Verrechnungskonto). Sometimes a bank account number is used (e.g., SKR04 = 1880; SKR03 = 1280). Once your tax consultant tells you which number is available, you can log into DATEV create an account (Kasse) that's dedicated to Pleo card expenses. The below video shows how to create a Kasse in a way that meets the following requirements: The account should have a name that is easily recognisable for you internally. The account should be the contra account you use for Pleo expenses. The date should reflect when you started using Pleo (for example, you could enter the date before your first Wallet top-up, the first date of the financial year, etc.). The amount should show your Wallet balance (e.g., zero) on the day that the Kasse is created. The shortfall option can be disabled as it's not possible for your Pleo Wallet to go into the negative. Ask your tax consultant for a list of common tax rates (for transport, meals, etc.) to be applied to Pleo card expenses. In Germany this is based on the \u00dcbersicht Steuerschl\u00fcssel (BU) key of tax rates. This list will be used later on in Part 2 when you input tax codes into Pleo. Ask your tax consultant for a list of expense categories that correspond to your chart of accounts.

Currently, we are not able to tell the individual supplier account used in DATEV when you export the payment. Therefore, we recommend you use a transitory account in our setup. Using a transitory account allows us to export complete booking records to DATEV Unternehmen online and DATEV Kanzlei Rechnungswesen. If you or your accountant wants to reconcile the payment against the correct supplier account, you/your accountant should write an additional booking record in DATEV Kanzlei: Supplier Account (debit) to Invoice Payments account (credit). If you chose to not use a transitory account, the payment will be exported without a contra account, which will create an Error message in DATEV Kanzlei Rechnungswesen. Your accountant can correct that booking record manually. How to set it up: Please ask your accountant/DATEV administrator which account number you should use and insert in Pleo for the Invoice payments account. We recommend depending on your accounting setup: a) A transitory account, e.g. 1360 Geldtransit (SKR 03) or 1460 Geldtransit (SKR 04) b) An account for diverse creditors \"Sammelkreditorn\", between 70000 and 90000 (SKR 03 & SKR 04) The account needs to be assigned/created in DATEV Kanzlei Rechnungswesen. You do not need to create a new Kassenbuch for this account in DATEV Unternehmen online! The payment will be exported in the existing Kassenbuch you use for the Pleo Wallet. \u261d\ufe0f All required settings for using Pleo Invoices with DATEV Unternehmen online here ."

And: You want to make changes to what you initially set up. For example, perhaps you're now tracking locations instead of projects, and want to have this change reflected in your tags. How to associate new tags/a new tag group with KOST1 and KOST2 Both of the below options focus on updating tags within an existing tag group in Pleo. The benefit of this approach is that old tags will not be lost. \"Old\" tags could be ones that you used to use to track projects, and are connected to expenses that have already been exported. Option 1: Within an existing tag group, archive tags and create new tags one by one To archive a tag, click the three dots and then click \"Archive row\": To manually add a new tag, double-click at the bottom of the table and start typing: Option 2: Within an existing tag group, re-upload a spreadsheet with a list of new tags If there are quite a few changes, you can save some time by Re-importing a spreadsheet with a list of tags: When you import the list, any previously used tags that are not in the spreadsheet will be automatically archived in Pleo. Optional step: If the tag group has completely changed, re-name the tag group. In your tag group overview in Pleo, click the three dots next to the affected group, and rename the group (e.g., from \"projects\" to \"locations\" or vice versa). Where to find archived tags If you follow the above instructions, old tags will not be deleted; they'll be moved to the \"Archived\" section in Pleo:"

If you want to learn more about the integration with DATEV Unternehmen online, skip this article and jump to this one instead. But if you prefer the CSV file option, please keep reading. This article covers: How to turn on the DATEV CSV option How to input necessary account numbers and more How to set up your tax codes How to export the CSV file from Pleo and import into DATEV Kanzlei Rechnungswesen Turn on the DATEV CSV option In the Pleo web app, go to the Accounting (Setup) page. Select the DATEV CSV option. Input account numbers, your DATEV client number, and more Once connected, you will need to input a contra account number . Ask your tax consultant which account number is available for Pleo expenses. Sometimes a bank account number is used (e.g., SKR04 = 1880; SKR03 = 1280). Input your tax consultant number . Input your DATEV client number . Input the starting month of your fiscal year (e.g., 1 for January, 12 for December). If you plan to use the Pleo Pocket feature, input a contra account number for Pocket expenses . It is optional to fill out an additional account number. The additional Pocket account number is only applicable if you plan on reimbursing employees outside of Pleo (e.g., via bank transfer). Set up your tax codes Scroll down to where it says Tax Codes (German: Steuer-Codes ). Click on +New (German: +Neu ) button to create a new row. Give your tax code a name that is easy for you to identify. The \"code\" column should reflect the related BU key. If the BU key starts with zero though, please remove that in Pleo (e.g., 09 becomes 9 in Pleo). Make sure to add in the tax percentage rate as well (e.g. 19%). A list of the most commonly used BU tax keys and percentages for DATEV can be found here . Your tax consultant can verify which are appropriate. Exporting the CSV file from Pleo In the Pleo web app, go to the Export page. Click on Export to export all selected expenses. The CSV file will be ready.

If the employee makes purchases across different departments Do your employees sometimes buy on behalf of different departments? Picking this option requires your employees to do an active act, in terms of selecting the right department for each single expense. Click on \" settings \" . Go to \" Accounting \" . Click on \" Tags \" Create a tag-group and call it \" Departments \" Open up the newly created tag-group and click \" Import \" in the top right corner. From here you should be able to import your departments from e-conomic. 2. If the expenses of your employees are always related to the same department Do your employees never make purchases on behalf of different departments? If picking this option, the employee does not have to actively select a department post-purchase. Click on \" Users \" Select \" Teams \" Create your departments Enter the right department code underneath \" Code \" Add the team members FYI Option 1 allows the user to select different departments for different expenses. Adding a department to the expense this way, requires an active act from the user. If going for Option 2, your employees do not have to think about adding the right department to the expense. Their expenses will always have the same department added to them. You can only have a maximum of 3 active tag-groups . If you have already created 3 tag-groups, you need to archive one of them.

      "text": "How to enable the projects module for you Pleo integration If you would like to have the e-conomic projects module synced with Pleo, you can reach out to our support team to enable that for you. Before we enable the module There are a few things that are good to know beforehand: You need to import tag groups (departments, projects, and cost types) directly from e-conomic to Pleo. If you add tags another way (e.g., uploading a spreadsheet), then the export will fail. If a Pleo expense has a projects tag, then it also needs a cost type tag (and vice versa). If an expense only has one or the other tag, then the export will fail. For expenses that are tagged with projects and cost types, the Pleo Category (a.k.a. account number in e-conomic) is not exported from Pleo to e-conomic. But the project and cost type will be exported from Pleo/imported to e-conomic. If your project module has its own contra account in e-conomic, then that will override the general contra account selected for Pleo expenses. Cost Types that are blocked in e-conomic are still imported to Pleo. The e-conomic API (that the integration depends on) does not allow Pleo to filter these out. If you don't mind the above dependencies, just let us know and we'll be happy to set the module live for your Pleo account. What an expense looks like in e-conomic after being exported from Pleo When looking at the image below, the \"project expense\" from January 4th shows a scenario where the project and cost centre tags have been used. In this case, the project module is enabled, meaning that the contra account number - 5817 - linked to the project module has been applied instead of the Pleo category. The cost centre tag is 3600 and the project tag is 75. In the \"normal expense\" (i.e., without the project module) below, no cost centre or project tag is applied. A department tag is applied, however, and in this case the Pleo Category was exported."

Setting up the accounts Once connected, you can set up the accounts that fit your system. Choose a verification series: This will be a letter, which will prefix every verification. Many customers choose to create a new verification series and use the letter P for Pleo, but you can also use any other fitting letter. Remember to set this up as \"Manuell kontering\" in Visma.

If you create several cost centre groups in Visma and import to Pleo, all of the cost centre info will end up in one tag group in Pleo. Unfortunately, a quirk in the current integration is that any expenses with tags that reflect additional cost centre groups will fail when you try to export them. How can you get around this? Well, the first option is to only have only one cost centre in Visma. If that's not feasible, you can still import all cost centres to Pleo, but it's important that employees only use tags from the first cost centre. Taking the example in the below image, the first cost centre would be the first from the left (Kostnadsenhet): Once you have enabled the integration, tax codes from eEkonomi should automatically appear in Pleo.

If the export worked but nothing comes up under \"Zuordnungsvorschl\u00e4ge\", that means something went wrong with the direct feed. We won't necessarily know exactly what went wrong (technology is a bit of a mystery sometimes), but we can fix it. Please contact our support team and we will manually re-trigger the direct feed from our system. If you don't see anything from Pleo under \"Belege,\" then the export failed.

In Sage200 these are: 4 = expense, negative value 5 = refund, positive value IMPORTANT Our Sage200 format in Pleo does this automatically, but unfortunately our custom format does not understand this, so if you choose to go with custom format - every time you export, we would need to double check if there are refunds and then manually change the type from 4 to be 5 on those refunds in the export file. These instructions how to set up and import transactions from Pleo to Sage200 are more of an example as your company's set up in Sage200 might differ. We recommend contacting your account manager in Sage if you are having issues with importing documents or you can always contact support@pleo.io if you have any additional questions. How to set up Custom Format for Sage 200c These instructions are more of an example that might not work for all versions of Sage200. If you have any questions, please contact our support@pleo.io Click on your profile image in the lower left hand corner and select Settings From the menu option, select Accounting Choose Custom Format as your accounting system Create Tax codes and set up the Settings like below: 3. Set up categories 4. Set up Tags (Cost centres) 5. Make sure you have set up the settings like below 6. Create the columns for your export file. Click \"New\" below the Columns. 7. Create each column using the image below as a reference IMPORTANT You can always change the column names and add more columns and datapoints if that works with your set up in Sage200. In Custom Format, you can also use Teams and the department code as another data point. You just need to choose Project ID and the data source to be \"Team code\". The team code is always fixed for each user. If employees always need to choose the tag, then we recommend using the Tags in Pleo and choosing \"tag name - ID\" as a data source. Read more about Tags from here ! Formatting the Sage200 columns You need to change some of the formatting in a few datapoints so you won't get errors when importing to Sage200 SYSTraderTranType datapoint to be 4 1. Choose Static Value 2. Click the 3 dots inside the green box 3. Write 4 in the empty row in the pop up window Change the date format 1. Choose Settled date 2. Click the 3 dots on the green box 3.

Choose verification series: This will be a letter, which will prefix every verification. Many customers choose to create a new verification series and use the letter P for Pleo, but you can also use any other fitting letter. Remember to set this up as \"Manuell kontering\" in Fortnox. Setup a Contra account number. We recommend customers to create a new account in the chart of accounts, using a number 194* for Pleo. Just as you would for a bank account. Choose a bank account for your Pleo Pocket expenses. This will be the transition account to which the expenses are accounted against until they have been reimbursed. Choose a Pocket reimbursement account. This will typically be the account from which you send the reimbursement. Last but not least is the ingoing VAT account for normal expenses, usually 2641 in Sweden. To add Cost centers (Kostnadsst\u00e4lle) and projects, head to Settings - Tags . Start by creating a tag group named either: SIE Projekt (columns should be \"Namn\" and \"Projektnr\") SIE Kostnadsst\u00e4lle (columns should be \"Namn\" and \"Kod\") Next step is to import an excel file containing the name and code which you can find in your bookkeeping system (either under the project module or the cost centers).

Feel free to watch the video if it makes it easier to follow along: In Uniconta, set up a contra account dedicated to Pleo expenses: Go to \"Accounts\" (Danish: \"Kontoplan\"). Click \"Add contra account\" (Danish: \"Tilf\u00f8j finanskonto\"). Enter an available contra account (Danish: modkonto) and label it \"Pleo\". Under \"Account type\" (Danish: \"Kontotype\"), select \"liquid assets\" (Danish: \"Likvide aktiver\"). Click \"Save\" (Danish: \"Gem\"). Next up in Uniconta, let's set up a Pleo Journal: In Uniconta, click \"Accounting\" (Danish: \"Bogf\u00f8ring\"). Click \"Add journal\" (Danish: \"Tilf\u00f8j kladde\"). Select \"Pleo\" in both the journal (Danish: \"kladde\") and name (Danish: \"navn\") fields. Select a number series (Danish: \"numbersseries\"). Scroll down until you see \"Standard values\" (Danish: \"Standardv\u00e6rdier\") and select the Pleo contra account. Click \"Save\" (Danish: \"Gem\"). Now it's time to choose which Pleo expense data you want to import: Click \"Import from file\" (Danish: \"Importer fra fil\"). Select the data points you want to see by entering the order in which they should appear in the file. For example, if you want the date (Danish: \"dato\") to appear first, then enter \"1\" in the field next to it. Click \"Save positions\" (Danish: \"Gem positioner\") and save it as \"Pleo\". Now it's time to log into Pleo and set up the custom format: Log into the Pleo web app and go to the Accounting page. Select \"Create your own format.\" Enter the same contra account (Danish: \"Modkonto\") that you saved in Uniconta and enter in the respective field in Pleo (\"Contra Account for Pleo card expenses\"). Scroll down to the \"File format\" (Danish: \"Filformat\") section, and enter the data points in the same order as you did in Uniconta. At the bottom of the page, you can download a file preview to see what will be uploaded to Uniconta. Now that it's all set up, you can export your expenses from Pleo as you and your colleagues start using your cards. When you export from Pleo, you'll be given the choice of Excel or .csv file. Once that's downloaded, upload the file in Uniconta: In Uniconta, click \"Accounting\" (Danish: \"Bogf\u00f8ring\"). Click \"Import from file\" (Danish: \"Importer fra fil\"). Select the file that you've downloaded from Pleo. Click \"Review\" (Danish: \"Gennemse\"). Click \"Upload file\" (Danish: \"Indl\u00e6s fil). Done! Option 2: FutureLink's custom-built integration FutureLink has built a custom integration that syncs expenses between Pleo and Uniconta. The only catch here is that it's an independent project from FutureLink, and so it comes with a fee. It's 99 DKK per month, plus a 990 DKK starting fee. From Pleo's side, the only prerequisite is access to our API . The main benefits of the integration (as opposed to the custom format) is that the receipt URL will be sent to Uniconta, meaning that expenses don't need to be manually matched to receipts. Interested? Check out this FutureLink page about the Pleo x Uniconta integration. Connect Pleo and Uniconta (FutureLink) Go to the integration page: https://connect.batchflow.dk . Log in with your Uniconta credentials. Select the company you want to set up the integration for and click \"Register\". If you need to set up several companies, repeat the steps below for all companies. Your company and contact information are automatically pulled from Uniconta. Tweak any details if necessary, tick the \"terms and conditions box\", then click \"Next\". Insert your Pleo API key and click \"Save\". Export expenses from Uniconta to Pleo (FutureLink) Expenses are automatically imported from Pleo, but you can always adjust the filters so that you only see expenses based on, say, a specific date range. To adjust the filters, click on \"Import expenses from Pleo\". Select all or specific expenses to be exported to Uniconta, then click \"Add to export queue\". Click \"Yes\" to confirm. Click \"Configure export\" on the \"Export queue\" page. If you want to remove expenses from the export queue, select the expenses and click \"Remove from queue\". Select a specific journal, and then choose to either book the expenses as a creditor or an account. Select the creditor/account. Select which values from Pleo to add to the journal in Uniconta (Click \"+\" to add another value. Click on the value to select a new one, or click \"Remove\". Fields are retrieved from Uniconta and \"Tag groups\" from Pleo can be selected as a value. Please note that values in Pleo must match the positions in Uniconta. Export expenses to Uniconta by clicking on \"Export to Uniconta\"."

How to connect Pleo and Xero Go to Settings in the Pleo web app. Click on Accounting. Click on Xero Click on Connect . Verify the connection in Xero. Done! A Pleo bank account has just been automatically created for you in Xero. Pleo Bank Feed How it works Once you complete the above steps, the Pleo Bank Feed is automatically turned on. When the Pleo Bank Feed is on, expenses from Pleo automatically sent to Xero. This takes place twice a day at 8am and 1pm (UTC). New expenses from Pleo are sent to the Reconcile feed in your Pleo bank account. This happens for Pleo card expenses that have been settled and Pocket expenses that have been approved. The statement data consists of the presentment date, the amount, and the merchant. Good to know: Even when the Pleo Bank Feed is enabled, it's still important to export your Pleo expenses to Xero. The Bank Feed includes the date, merchant, amount, and name of the employee who made the purchase. To get extra info about the purchase (e.g., Categories, Tags), exporting is the way to go. If you start using Pleo in the middle of your financial year, the statement balance in Xero will start from 0. However, your Xero balance should show the same as the balance in Pleo. In order to sync the statement balance to the Xero balance in Pleo, follow these steps . How to disable the Bank Feed Almost all of our customers who use Xero prefer to keep the Pleo Bank Feed turned on. That said, if you want to disable it: You You can enable the Direct Feed by following the steps below. Go to Settings in the Pleo web app. Click on Accounting and scroll to the bottom of the page. Un-tick the box next to Pleo Bank Feed . What data is synced between Pleo and Xero?

When you set up your categories after enabling the integration, the drop-down menu in Pleo will automatically reflect your account numbers in Xero. That said, you will need to give the specific category (account number) a name. The name should be easy for employees to recognise when they assign details to their Pleo purchases (e.g., business trips). \"Tags\" in Pleo reflect your tracking categories and customers in Xero. When you import your tags, choose the \"import from Xero\" options so that everything syncs automatically.

It's good to know that: Once you've connected Pleo to your Xero account , the Pleo Bank Feed is already turned on. You can see it at the bottom of the Accounting page in Pleo. With the Pleo Bank Feed, the following expense info automatically goes to Xero: amount, date, employee, and merchant name. Expenses are only sent over when they are presented. If your company has any such expenses, Pleo will send the info over twice per day. Additional expense info (expense categories, tags, pictures of paper receipts, etc.) is sent when you export from Pleo to Xero. So, in a nutshell, you'll need to: Log into Pleo and export your latest expenses. Log into Xero, go to the Reconcile tab under Pleo, and click the \"OK\" button to reconcile the Pleo expenses: Option 2: Reconcile manually in Xero** **Only use this method if something goes wrong with the Pleo Bank Feed. Which hopefully won't happen. But if it does, please feel free to ask us for help before choosing this rather manual method. Ensure your transfers to Pleo are allocated. The expenses that you export from Pleo to Xero will show up in Xero under \"Account Transactions.\" Turn on the \"Mark as Reconciled\" option in Xero: Once the screen has refreshed, click on the \"More\" (just above the list of expenses). Click on the \"Mark as Reconciled\" button to reconcile the expense(s): If you really want to, you can compare the current Statement Balance in Xero with the corresponding historic balance in Pleo's Export - Wallet page:"

You can adjust the data to be compatible with the accounting system of your choice (NetSuite, Sage 200c, Navision, etc). The below steps take you through the one-time custom format setup. Once you've got your format customised to your accounting needs, you'll save lots of time by not having to amend the export file every time. Step 1: Select the custom format Click on Settings .

      "text": "What is the regulation on digitisation of receipts? If a company - or Pleo on the company\u2019s behalf - wants to convert a physical receipt into digital format, the French and Spanish tax authorities require that the digitisation is carried out as one automatic step. The automated process is often referred to as \u2018dematerialisation\u2019. If the automatic digitisation process and the specific regulatory steps for digitising are followed, you can throw away the paper receipts. Why do the authorities require one-step digitisation? Because they need to ensure that the digital receipt is in fact an identical copy of the original paper receipt. The goal is that: the origin and authenticity of the physical receipts are guaranteed within the digitisation process, no modification can take place during or after a paper receipt has been digitised the risk of tax fraud is mitigated Our efforts to ensure regulatory compliance Pleo\u2019s solution is set up in a way that ensures that your receipts can not be modified, enhanced or in any other way interfere with the original picture of the receipt/invoice during the digitisation process. This means that we convert images of receipts into PDFs. We timestamp and then sign them with a digital certificate that ensures the integrity of the receipts throughout the retention period. Pleo only does this for our customers based in France and Spain, as these specific regulations only apply in these countries. Which receipts can you throw away when using Pleo? If your organisation is based in France or Spain, only pictures of physical receipts taken directly via the Pleo App can be sealed, stamped and certified in accordance with the process mentioned above . This is Pleo's only digitisation method of paper receipts that complies with French and Spanish tax law. The Pleo application still allows uploading receipts from the camera roll on your mobile device and/or uploading them directly to the web application. However, pictures of receipts uploaded in these ways will not be sealed and timestamped as we can not guarantee the authenticity of the picture taken outside of the Pleo App. We will however store those pictures so that you can easily find them going forward FAQ Is Pleo compliant with the digitisation regulation in my country? Yes, Pleo has a fully compliant solution and holds an electronic certificate that allows and enables us (according to the local rules and the Spanish/French authorities) to digitise, optimise the image (making it a pdf and inserting the date and time at which the picture of the receipt was taken) and then finally sign the PDF file if the picture has been taken with the Pleo app camera. Which receipts can I throw away with Pleo? The regulation only allows us to stamp, certify and seal the physical receipts that are taken directly with the Pleo App as this is considered an automatic digitisation process. If receipts are not digitised this way it would provide the possibility of someone editing the physical receipt before adding it in the Pleo app.  Hence: For pictures of receipts taken within the Pleo App, you can throw away your physical receipt \ud83d\udc4d For receipts uploaded into the app from your phone gallery (camera roll) or from the Pleo web app, you should keep the physical receipts, because we cannot guarantee their authenticity \ud83d\udc4e Why does Pleo not certify the receipts uploaded from the picture gallery and webpage? We work within the limitations the regulation provides and are committed to providing a compliant solution for our customers. Those limitations are common to everyone in the market and should apply to all comparable solutions. How do I find my certified receipts on Pleo? Only receipts uploaded directly via the Pleo App camera function will be certified by Pleo. You can find the stamp once you download the receipt from the Export page within Pleo, and open the PDF with a PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat reader. You will see the signature there. Why does Pleo not certify my email receipts that are captured by Fetch? The Fetch receipts are already issued as digital receipts, which means they won\u2019t get stamped as they have not been transformed from physical receipts to digital format. It is only when you change the format from physical to digital receipt that the regulation applies. Do you still have questions? Please reach out to us on the live chat in the Pleo app or via email at support@pleo.io"

      "text": "What is the regulation on the digitisation of receipts in Luxembourg? PSDC status in a nutshell If your organisation is based in Luxembourg, a digital copy of a physical receipt can only be accepted by itself for bookkeeping, accounting and VAT purposes if the digitisation was made by a dematerialisation service provider, also referred to as a PSDC . In other words, the Luxembourg tax authority is not guaranteed to honour digital receipts that were digitised by a non-PSDC provider. Currently, the PSDC status is still voluntary as the certification process remains slow and only a few organisations have managed to obtain PSDC status. If the digitisation is carried out by a non-PSDC digitalisation provider such as Pleo , we recommend that you still keep physical receipts and invoices. We recommend keeping the physical receipts because we have not implemented the step in the PSDC-process from where it follows that you need to collect your physical receipts and proceed to their dematerialisation. You can read more about this here . What does the Law say about my digitised receipts? According to article 1334-1 of the Luxembourg Civil Code, digital copies of physical receipts/invoices will have the same value as the originals from which they were made if a PSDC made these copies. Although the same article states that a judge may not reject a copy for the sole reason of it being a digital copy or for it not being made by a PSDC, it is certain that a non-PSDC copy does not automatically enjoy the same benefits as a PSDC-made one because a judge could ultimately reject the digitised receipts as evidence in a court case. How does Pleo digitise paper receipts? Pleo allows you to take pictures of physical receipts directly within the Pleo App , upload receipts from the camera roll on your mobile device and/or upload receipts directly into the web application. Our solution is also set up in a way that ensures that your receipts cannot be modified, enhanced or in any other way interfere with the original picture of the receipt/invoice during the digitisation process. According to the law in Luxembourg, this process cannot guarantee the authenticity of these digital receipts for bookkeeping, accounting and VAT purposes as we are not PSDC certified. We will, however, store those pictures so that you can easily find them. Which receipts do I need to store when using Pleo? If your organisation is based in Luxembourg, we recommend that: \ud83d\udc49  All physical receipts and invoices that were digitised must be stored in their physical form for a duration of 10 years as of the issuance date. \ud83d\udc4d  Electronic invoices can be stored in their electronic form . This is Pleo's way of complying with Luxembourg tax law. FAQ Is Pleo compliant with the digitisation regulation in my country? Pleo follows the local rules and guidance from Luxembourg authorities. However, Pleo is not a certified PSDC digitisation provider. This means that you cannot throw away your physical receipts because we cannot guarantee the integrity, confidentiality and durability of electronic archives throughout their retention period. Can I throw away receipts with Pleo? You should store all physical receipts for a duration of 10 years as of the issuance date because we are not a certified PSDC digitisation provider. This includes all pictures of receipts taken with the Pleo App as well as receipts uploaded into the app from your phone gallery and/or from the Pleo web app. Why do I need to store physical receipts with Pleo? Even though the Pleo method of digitisation currently satisfies most local laws in the European markets we operate in, we of course work within the limitations the regulation provides and are committed to providing a compliant solution for our customers in Luxembourg. Rules in Luxembourg regarding the digitisation of receipts are more strict than in most European countries. How does this apply to my email receipts that are captured by Fetch? Electronic invoices such as email receipts captured by Fetch can be stored in their electronic version. Do you still have questions?

      "text": "What is the regulation on the digitisation of receipts in Italy? CAD and conservazione sostitutiva in a nutshell If a company - or Pleo on the company\u2019s behalf - wants to convert physical receipts into a digital format and guarantee their legal and fiscal validity in case of an audit, the Italian law has introduced a specific process known as \u2018Conservazione Sostitutiva\u2019. According to the Italian Digital Administration Code, \u201cCAD\u201d, tax-relevant documents issued or received in paper form can be digitised and stored in their electronic form provided a series of technical requirements are met to ensure their authenticity, integrity, reliability, searchability and retrievability (CAD art. 44). These requirements apply to all invoices, receipts and tax receipts. If the requirements outlined by the CAD guidelines above are followed and your organisation is based in Italy, you may then throw away your digitised paper receipts. What does this mean for your receipt storage under Italian Law? Please keep in mind that the storage of physical documents in any digital format does not automatically grant digitised tax-relevant documents the same legal status as the original paper documents in case of an audit. You will need to follow the extensive guidelines laid out by CAD. \ud83d\udc4d If your organisation is based in Italy and your receipts are digitally archived through the Conservazione Sostitutiva certification, you may then throw away your paper receipts that have been digitised. \ud83d\udc4e Otherwise, you will have to store your physical receipts for a duration of 10 years as of the issuance date. Our efforts to ensure regulatory compliance We are building a fully compliant solution in Italy We are working with a service provider of long-term archiving services to ensure full compliance and offer a digitisation solution in Italy. We expect to have a conservazione sostitutiva service integrated with the Pleo platform hopefully by the end of 2022. Once this happens, you will be able to upload & digitise new paper receipts with the Pleo app and throw away the original paper receipts afterwards. Until then, we\u2019re rolling out an interim solution for our customers Pleo already allows you to take pictures of physical receipts directly within the Pleo App , upload receipts from the camera roll on your mobile device and/or upload receipts directly into the web application. Our solution is also set up in a way that ensures that your receipts cannot be modified, enhanced or in any other way interfere with the original picture of the receipt/invoice during the digitisation process. Pleo not only saves you time and money on expenses, invoices and reimbursements but also allows your finance team better control and productivity. However, in light of the extensive CAD guidelines, the Italian legislation regarding the digitisation and conservation of receipts are more strict than in most European countries. This means that our current digitisation process does not meet the requirements under the Italian law as-is. We will keep storing your uploaded receipt pictures so that you can easily find them, but for the time being, we highly recommend that you store your paper receipts physically as well . We will notify you as soon as our conservazione sostitutiva service is available. FAQ Is Pleo compliant with the digitisation regulation in my country? Pleo follows the local rules and guidance from Italian authorities. However, our current solution cannot guarantee the authenticity of digital receipts for audit purposes under Italian law. We are working to be compliant and to offer a conservazione sostitutiva service integrated with the Pleo platform very soon. We will notify you when this happens. We highly recommend that you store your physical receipts until then for a duration of 10 years as of the issuance date. This includes all pictures of receipts taken with the Pleo App as well as receipts uploaded into the app from your phone gallery and/or from the Pleo web app. Why do I need to store my paper receipts with Pleo currently? Until we have finished building our conservazione sostitutiva service, Pleo is not fully compliant with the Italian legislation for digitising and storing the pictures of your receipt just yet. Therefore we highly recommend you store your physical receipts for audit & taxation purposes. How does this apply to e-invoices and email receipts that are captured by Fetch? The conservazione sostitutiva service will also apply to the archiving of e-receipts. Do you still have questions?

It\u2019s not currently possible to switch the authenticator method (from SMS to authenticator app or vice versa) by yourself, even if you still have access to your account. If you don\u2019t have access to your account Because Pleo is a financial institution, we\u2019re extra careful when it comes to the security of your account. This article explains what to do if a passcode or two-factor authentication method (SMS or authenticator app) needs to be changed for: Employees Admins External bookkeepers Partner bookkeepers Please keep in mind that any reset emails are only valid for 24 hours. Employees Any account admins or bookkeepers (with extended access) can reset a passcode or authentication method for an employee. If your role in Pleo is \u201cemployee\u201d and you\u2019re not sure who has access to reset your passcode, please contact our support team . How to reset an employee\u2019s passcode: Click on \" People \u201d. Click on the person who needs a reset. Click on the three dots in the top right corner. Click on \"Reset passcode\" (if your colleague needs to choose a new 4-digit passcode) or \"Reset two-factor login\" (if your colleague needs to change their phone number or choose an authenticator app): Click \u201cReset\u201d to confirm. Admins Any of the other account admins or bookkeepers (with extended access) can reset a passcode or authentication method for an admin. To do so, please follow the same steps as in the above \u201cEmployees\u201d section. If you\u2019re the only admin for your account and there are no bookkeepers with extended access, our support team can send you a passcode or authentication reset email. For financial security reasons though, please send our support team either: Proof of transfer (also called proof of payment) from your last Wallet top-up to Pleo. This should be in PDF, PNG, or JPEG format, and clearly show the transfer date, amount, payer (your company) and payee's (Pleo) details. Or If you haven\u2019t topped up your Pleo Wallet yet, please send over a PDF, PNG, or JPEG file from your company\u2019s online banking that clearly shows the company name and account number. External bookkeepers If an external bookkeeper is only connected to one Pleo account, then any admin or bookkeeper with extended access can trigger a reset. To do so, please follow the same steps as in the above \u201cEmployees\u201d section. If an external bookkeeper is connected to more than one Pleo account, our support team can send them a passcode and/or authentication reset email. Similar to the case of the admin though, we\u2019ll need to see proof of transfer from the external bookkeeper\u2019s clients. If they\u2019re connected to three or more client accounts, we\u2019ll need to see proof of transfer (latest Wallet top-up) from three different clients. If they\u2019re connected to one or two clients, we\u2019ll need to see the respective proofs of transfer. For details on what the proof of transfer should include, please see the above \u201cAdmins\u201d section. Partner bookkeepers If a bookkeeper working for a Pleo Partner accountancy needs a reset, any of the Partner Portal admins can reset it for them: Click on \u201c People .\u201d Click on the person who needs a reset. Click on \"Reset passcode\" (if your colleague needs to choose a new 4-digit passcode) or \"Reset two-factor login\" (if your colleague needs to change their phone number or choose an authenticator app): Click \u201cReset\u201d to confirm. If you are the only partner admin and: Your firm has its own Pleo account: Please follow the proof of transfer instructions within the \u201cAdmins\u201d section above. Or Your firm does not have its own Pleo account: Please follow the proof of transfer instructions within the \u201cExternal bookkeepers\u201d section above. Need help?

Because tax codes are pulled from Xero, we've intentionally made it so that it's not possible to change them in Pleo. If you were to edit tax codes in Pleo but not Xero, that would cause problems when you later export expenses. So if you need to change any tax codes, please: Log into Xero and change the tax codes Log into Pleo and re-import your Categories (this will automatically update the respective tax codes). What to do if you see the export message \"Tax rate must be Active\" The cause: This message means that you've imported your Categories (and respective tax codes) from Xero, but someone has since archived a tax code in Xero. Because the tax code that\u2019s no longer active in Xero, the Pleo expense can't be exported. The solution: Please re-import your Categories from Xero .

By this time, the original Pleo expense has already been sent to Xero via the Pleo Bank Feed. This creates a problem when you later need to reconcile expenses after exporting them from Pleo.

This article explains why this is happening and how to fix it. Step 1: Please humour us and try a different browser. Pleo should work swimmingly across all popular web browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.). That said, sometimes weird things happen in a specific web browser. So before we ask you to do anything else, please humour us and try reconnecting Xero using Pleo on a different web browser. If that solves the problem\u2014great! If it doesn\u2019t, keep reading. Step 2: Fix the chart of accounts in Xero. As part of a valiant effort to organise financial reports, an accountant has likely changed the code of a Pleo bank account in Xero. This change is what causes the connection between Pleo and Xero to fail. The solution is to change the codes back to their original format. Log into Xero. Click \u201cAccounting\u201d in the top bar. Click \u201cChart of Accounts\u201d from the options. Type \u201cPleo\u201d in the search box on the right-hand side of the chart of accounts section. Click on the codes and change the names back to \u201cPLEO\u201d, \u201cPLEOBANK\u201d, and \u201cPLEOPOCKET\u201d (as shown in the below image). Please note that \u201cPLEOPOCKET\u201d is only relevant to our customers who use Pocket functionality. Step 3: Go back to Pleo and try reconnecting to Xero again.

Error: Es ist ein Kassenminuspr\u00fcfung aufgetreten (a negative account balance occurred) The cause: Wallet loads from Pleo can also be exported to Datev, in which case they show up as credits which are then offset against Pleo expenses (debits). For this reason, the account in Datev needs to be able to go into minus with the total balance. When Datev isn\u2019t set up this way, the above error message appears in Pleo. The solution: Change the account details in the relevant Datev account. To do so, click \u201cOptionen\u201d (options) in the top right, then click then \u201cKassenstammdaten verwalten\u201d (manage account data). Next, click \"deaktivieren\u201d (deactivate). Please note that you might need special permission to be able to change this in Datev. If it's not possible to change the above setting (i.e., the button is greyed out), then the account (Kasse) should be deleted and re-created with the negative account balance (Kassenminuspr\u00fcfung) disabled. Error: Belegkreis im Kassenbuch nicht gefunden (the account was not found) The cause: This comes up when the contra account in Pleo does not match the account (Kasse) in Datev. The solution: Create an account (Kasse) for Pleo in Datev: Then add that same number to Pleo\u2019s settings page: Error: Vor dem Anfangsbestand... (Before the date of the opening balance\u2026 ) The cause: The export fails when an expense is dated before the opening date of the balance in Datev (Datum Anfangsbestand). For example, an expense from June 1st cannot be exported into an account (Kasse) which starts on June 15. The solution: While it\u2019s possible to re-open accounts for certain accounting tools, this is generally not possible in Datev. There are two alternative solutions: To create a new account (Kasse) in Datev which fits the time frame of the expenses that need to be exported from Pleo. Create the expense in Datev manually (having downloaded the receipt over from the Pleo expense). Next, remove the expense from Pleo by switching to the generic format and then reconnecting to Datev ."

Reward The referrer gets a \u00a3200/\u20ac200 Amazon voucher, and the company being referred gets their first two months on Pleo completely free of charge. Once the company you referred has set up a Pleo account and completed the verification process, we'll reach out to you via email with a gift voucher. Terms and Conditions The referred company must complete Pleo\u2019s verification process. The referred company must be registered in one of the following countries: the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Norway. Only one reward per referred company can be awarded. This means that even if more than one person from a given company signed up to Pleo through a referral link, only one reward will be awarded for the successful referral of that company. If several people refer the same company to Pleo and that company starts using Pleo, only the first person to have referred that company will get the reward. A person can refer as many companies as they want. There is no limit to how many rewards a person can receive. To refer another company, you need to have an active Pleo account. The company you refer cannot be one you work at, operate, or own."

        "description": "How do we use Strong Customer Authentication and why?"
      },
      "text": "From September 2019, as part of the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), new requirements known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to authenticate online payments and logins are being introduced across Europe. What is Strong Customer Authentication? The biggest requirement introduced under PSD2 to enhance the user security is calledStrong Customer Authentication (SCA). SCA is a form of two-factor authentication designed to prove that end-customers are who they say they are, with specific rules around what constitutes \u2018authentication\u2019. There are three valid categories of authentication available as part of SCA: Knowledge: SOMETHING you KNOW - e.g. passcode Possession: SOMETHING you HAVE - e.g. phone Inherence: SOMETHING you ARE - e.g. biometrics Only when the payer has been able to provide two of these forms of authentication, they will be allowed to perform the intended action. Through 2-factor authentication, Pleo ensures that the end customer is the rightful owner of the Pleo account or other payment mechanism. If you would like to read the regulatory requirements, head to the Regulatory Technical Standards. When do you need to use Strong Customer Authentication? The increased security measure will be required for authenticating online payments and account access. This means that 2-factor authentication will be performed any time you: access your Pleo account; carry out payment with your Pleo card*. Unless correctly authenticated, the user will NOT be allowed to perform the online transaction. * Bear in mind that not all transactions are subject to Strong Customer Authentication. How will Strong Customer Authentication impact your Pleo usage? Through Strong Customer Authentication we guarantee an increased level of security by ensuring that it is really you using the account. You will be required extra authentication steps at account login and when performing payments. SCA at login All Pleo users, when logging into the Pleo account, both on browser and app, you will be prompted to carry out the 2-Factors authentication via two of the elements described above (possession, knowledge, inherence).  If you have trouble logging in, check this help article here. Make sure to always have your login details at hand. If you are unable to login or have forgotten the login credentials, your Admin will be able to help you. SCA on online payment: 3DS.2 We USE 3D Secure (3DS.2) technology to protect you when making purchases online. 3DS.2 makes payments more secure by asking card owners to approve payments they make online by verifying their identity. More Information For more information about 3DS.2 in Pleo read here . For further clarification on Mastercard\u00ae Secure Code (the Mastercard\u00ae 3DS protocol used by Pleo cards) head here: FAQs"

      "text": "Pleo can help you easily attach online receipts, straight from your inbox. In order to do so, we need to connect directly to your email account, which is not something we take lightly. This article outlines the security and privacy aspects of making this integration and ends with how to set up Fetch. Our efforts to ensure the security of our infrastructure The Pleo application and its external infrastructure are assessed periodically to ensure that the highest industry standards can be guaranteed at all times. This includes penetration tests and external assessments to identify any weaker area. In addition, Pleo is PCI-DSS certified and is therefore required to adhere to all the requirements stated by the PCI Security Standards Council. Some common questions How do we guarantee compliance with Data security laws? Only if explicit consent is provided, Pleo may access user data for the purpose of enabling automatic email fetching. Communications are encrypted end to end and emails are parsed to fetch receipts but never read by the human eye. We will not process personal data for a longer period than is necessary for fulfilling the purpose, and the customer\u2019s data is never processed for any other purpose as set out in our Privacy Policy . For the scope of emails receipts finders, personal data might be parsed but not stored or retained on our servers. Remember that to be able to enable the system, the Pleo user must be signed in to their email account and must grant the authorisations requested by the email provider as they are necessary for the rendering of the Service. What data are we retrieving from your inbox? Just emails or attachments that match our strict criteria for receipts. Depending on the format receipts are sent in, we either retrieve the attachment from an email (for instance when an invoice is attached as a PDF) or we convert the body of the email into a PDF and retrieve that. Emails that look a lot like a receipt We developed an engine that determines quickly whether your email is or contains a receipt. Most of the time it does this pretty well, but there is an off chance that it finds a document that looks a lot like a receipt but it isn't exactly that, it could for instance be the shipping confirmation. In this case it will still upload the receipt to Pleo, but you can easily remove the receipt again from the app. Note that several things need to be true before we attach a receipt to an expense: it should match the exact amount and currency of the purchase, match the date of the purchase, and contain words such as \"invoice\" or \"receipt\". This way we minimise the risk of retrieving unrelated emails. Are we storing your emails in our database? No, we're not. The only thing we store in our database is the matching receipt that is attached to your expense in Pleo. Any scanned receipts that fail to match will not be stored. Will my regular emails ever get in front of human eyes? No, that won't happen. First of all, this would never be something we'd feel comfortable with, but it's also in direct violation with email providers' terms and conditions for integrations. Can I revoke access to my inbox? Yes, you can - at any time. You can revoke Pleo's access to your inbox at any time, either from Pleo's mobile app (find Power-ups in the settings) or through the admin settings of the email provider. Where can I report a security vulnerability I encountered? In the odd case you do find a security vulnerability please report it to us here . We will handle incoming reports with the highest priority. Ready to get going? Read more about how to set up Fetch for Gmail , Outlook or Microsoft 365 ."
